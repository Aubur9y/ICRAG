    "response": "The process of discretization transforms continuous equations into discrete forms for numerical computation. Derivatives are approximated using finite differences, such as forward (Δt) or backward (Δt) differences, leading to algebraic equations solvable iteratively (Context 1, Context 2). For example, forward Euler uses $ C_{i+1} = C_i(1 + \\lambda \\Delta t) $, while backward Euler requires solving $ C_{i+1} = \\frac{C_i}{1 - \\lambda \\Delta t} $ (Context 1). Centered differences, like $ \\frac{C_{i+1} - C_{i-1}}{2\\Delta t} $, offer higher accuracy but demand more spatial points (Context 2). Discretization choices (e.g., stencil size, grid resolution) impact numerical stability, computational cost, and the model's ability to capture physical processes like advection or turbulence (Context 3, Context 4). These methods discretize partial differential equations into systems solvable via numerical integration.",
