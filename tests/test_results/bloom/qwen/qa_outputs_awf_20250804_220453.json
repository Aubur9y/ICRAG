If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753902702794239, 'score': 0.6741034, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_8', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'cool and warm the climateThe microphysics responsible for cloud formation is not well understoodThe grid cells in models are much much bigger than time/space scales relevant for cloud physicsÞMagnitude/location of rain events is hard to predict wellÞThat information is useful though!\\nComparing models with data•What is a data point?

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753902299806645, 'score': 0.6867362, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_2', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' problem under study, etc.\\nWhat does a model need?A very simple numerical exampledCdt=λCCi+1−Citi+1−ti=λCiCi+1=Ci1+λΔt()dCdt=limΔt→0C(t+Δt)−C(t)ΔtRequires discretization of derivativesand numerical integration to step forward from tito tf=NDTForward difference(aka Forward Euler)[climatemodelsusemuchmorecomplex schemes]\\nii+1\\nWhat does a model need?Discretization needed to implement numericallydCdt=λCCi+1−CiΔt=λCi+1Ci+1=λΔtCi+1+CiCi+1=Ci11−λΔtBackward difference(aka backward Euler)Requires solving', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 2}}, {'id': 1753903424509295, 'score': 0.6856959, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 01- Introduction to climate data and climate models\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n## Contents\\n- [Lectures](#lectures)\\n- [Question](#question)\\n- [ESMValTool](#ESMValTool)\\n- [Sources of climate data](#climatedata)\\n- [CEDA](#CEDA)\\n- [File formats](#fileformat)\\n- [Metadata](#metadata)\\n- [NetCDF](#NetCDF)\\n- [NCO](#NCO)\\n- [Reanalysis products](#reanalysis)\\n- [Climate services UKCP18](#ukcp18)\\n  \\n## Learning outcomes\\n1.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \\n\\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that\\'s a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \\n\\nAlthough UKCP18 is \\'just\\' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.

The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \\n\\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\\n\\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \\n\\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\\n\\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \\nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \\n\\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \\n\\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \\n\\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \\n\\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\\n3. Output: Data only\\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\\n   \\nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \\n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \\n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \\n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \\n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can\\'t differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \\n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that\\'s a lot of data!).\\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \\n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \\n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \\n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don\\'t close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \\n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \\n\\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\\n\\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \\n\\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we\\'ll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\\n\\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 46}}, {'id': 1753903424262111, 'score': 0.6410087, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_38_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='reanalysis'></a>\\n\\n# Reanalysis products\\n\\n![C3S](img/c3s-logo.png)\\n![ECMWF](img/logo-ecmwf.png) \\n\\n[*ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables. The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}]",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions).

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+.

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424357433, 'score': 0.6413517, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_5_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='climatedata'></a>\\n\\n# Working with climate data and climate models\\n\\n### Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)\\n\\n![esgf](img/ESGF_logo.png)\\n\\n\\n[ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov) is an open-source platform that provides distributed access to peta/exa-scale scientific data, **globally**. \\n\\nIt is an interagency and international effort led by the US Department of Energy (DOE), co-funded by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the US National Science Foundation (NSF), and other international partners, such as the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) German Climate Computing Centre (DKRZ), the Australian National University (ANU) National Computational Infrastructure (NCI), Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), and the **Centre for Environmental Data Analysis ([CEDA](https://www.ceda.ac.uk))** in the UK.\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 5}}, {'id': 1753901956989969, 'score': 0.63997614, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_2', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g.calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).Learning objectives of the Environmental Data module•Growing/important field –with likely career opportunities•Great playground to deliver learning objectives\\nUsing climate models: quantification/forecasting(impacts, adaptation, mitigation)\\nhttps://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts\\nUsing climate models: designscenarios(explore policy,', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf', 'chunk_number': 2}}, {'id': 1753902702697836, 'score': 0.63554025, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_5', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ent become stronger (strong exchange, although on shorter spatial scales, e.g.air-sea heat fluxes)•Better agreement with the way data are collected (i.e.what observations mean)–Averaging over space/time and variabilityhttps://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/climate-modeling/\\nGulf Stream\\nLabrador Sea~100km cells~10km cells\\nOcean resolution: 2 casesresolving eddies (the ocean’ storms)\\nFigure 6.1.

    "response": "Here's a structured summary of key concepts and practices when working with NetCDF files using the `netCDF4` Python library, based on the provided information:\n\n\n- **Structure**: NetCDF variables are multidimensional arrays (e.g., 1D, 2D, 3D). They are created with `Dataset.createVariable`, specifying a name and data type (e.g., `f8`, `i4`).\n- **Dimensions**: Dimensions are called **coordinate variables** and are defined as tuples. Example: `dimensions = ('time', 'level')`.\n- **Attributes**: Variables can have global or variable-specific attributes. Use `Dataset.ncattrs()` to retrieve attributes.\n\n\n- **Global vs. Variable Attributes**: \n  - **Global** attributes apply to the entire dataset.\n  - **Variable attributes** apply to specific variables.\n- **Masking**: By default, `netCDF4` masks values equal to `missing_value` or `_FillValue`. Use `Dataset.set_auto_mask()` to force unmasking (return all values).\n\n\n- **Purpose**: Exclude data points (e.g., ocean vs. land) using `_FillValue` attributes.\n- **Example**: \n  ```python\n  import numpy as np\n  data = np.ma.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]], mask=[[False, True], [False, False]])\n  print(data)  # Masks the second element of the second row\n  ```\n\n\n- **NetCDF4 vs. NumPy**:\n  - **NetCDF4**: Slicing is more flexible (e.g., `temp[0, 0, [0,1,2,3], [0,1,2,3]]` returns a 4x4 array).\n  - **NumPy**: Slicing is stricter (e.g., `temp[0, 0, 0, 0]` returns a 1D array).\n- **Example**: Extract data from a 4D array (e.g., time, level, lat, lon) using slicing.\n\n\n- **`netCDF4`**:\n  - Python interface for NetCDF files.\n  - Supports formats: NETCDF3_CLASSIC, NETCDF3_64BIT, NETCDF4.\n  - Example: Create a NetCDF file:\n    ```python\n    import netCDF4 as",

NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\\n\\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \\n\\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\\n\\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+.

If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\\n\\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \\n\\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement. The contoured estimate will tend to either over or underestimate the true value, within a tolerance controlled by the noise associated with the measurements. \\n\\nThe shape of the fitted surface will depend strongly on the data available: their locations, their uncertainties, as well as subjective choices made during the analysis (i.e. definition of the so-called 'covariance matrix').\\n\\nWe will here look at a technique called **kriging**, pioneered by a South African mining engineer called Danie G. Krige (1919-2013) and further formalized by geologist and mathematician Georges Matheron (1930-2000), who, together with Jean Serra, is often considered to be the founder of geostatistics.\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 21}}, {'id': 1753903968777554, 'score': 0.6067111, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_23_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '#### Mathematical formulation (only the basic setup of the problem, not the solution)\\n\\nThe general problem is to compute an estimate $\\\\hat{F}(\\\\vec{x}_0,t)$ of the true field $F(\\\\vec{x}_0,t)$ at query position $\\\\vec{x}_0$ from a finite number of scattered observations $f(\\\\vec{x}_n,t)$ taken at locations $\\\\vec{x}_n$, with $n=1,2,...,N$.\\n\\nIf we consider a snap-shot in time, i.e. dropping the time index $t$, the generalized kriging problem can be stated as\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\hat{F}(\\\\vec{x}_0)=\\\\overline{F(\\\\vec{x})}+\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^Nb(x_i)(f(x_i)-\\\\overline{f(x_i)})\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nwhere the overbars denote the expectation value (i.e. the mean) and the $b(x_i)$ are yet unspecified weighting coefficients for each data point $x_i$, subject to $\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^Nb(x_i)=1$.\\n\\nThe generalized kriging problem equation above means that to predict the value of the field $\\\\hat{F}(\\\\vec{x}_0)$ at a query location $\\\\vec{x}_0$, a good guess is to start with the mean (or some known structure) of the overall field $\\\\overline{F(\\\\vec{x})}$, to which we add corrections. For any given query point $\\\\vec{x}_0$, the necessary correction is calcuated as a weighted sum of contributions from the available samples $x_i$. The big question is what values should the weight corresponding to each sample have? Answering this question is not easy - it is basically the whole point of kriging. The answer will depend on any additional constraints that one applies on these weights and on any additional properties one wishes the field $F$ or $D$ to have (stationarity of various moments, isotropy, etc.). Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}]",

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424509295, 'score': 0.6501966, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 01- Introduction to climate data and climate models\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n## Contents\\n- [Lectures](#lectures)\\n- [Question](#question)\\n- [ESMValTool](#ESMValTool)\\n- [Sources of climate data](#climatedata)\\n- [CEDA](#CEDA)\\n- [File formats](#fileformat)\\n- [Metadata](#metadata)\\n- [NetCDF](#NetCDF)\\n- [NCO](#NCO)\\n- [Reanalysis products](#reanalysis)\\n- [Climate services UKCP18](#ukcp18)\\n  \\n## Learning outcomes\\n1.

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \\n\\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe (\\'18\\' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \\n\\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that\\'s a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \\n\\nAlthough UKCP18 is \\'just\\' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\\n\\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\\n\\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn\\'t contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \\n\\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\\n\\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \\n\\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\\n\\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \\nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \\n\\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \\n\\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \\n\\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \\n\\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\\n3. Output: Data only\\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\\n   \\nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \\n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \\n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \\n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \\n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can\\'t differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \\n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that\\'s a lot of data!).\\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \\n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \\n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \\n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don\\'t close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \\n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \\n\\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\\n\\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \\n\\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we\\'ll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\\n\\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 46}}]"

If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\\n\\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \\n\\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement.

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \\n\\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe (\\'18\\' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \\n\\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that\\'s a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \\n\\nAlthough UKCP18 is \\'just\\' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\\n\\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\\n\\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn\\'t contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \\n\\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\\n\\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \\n\\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\\n\\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \\nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \\n\\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \\n\\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \\n\\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \\n\\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\\n3. Output: Data only\\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\\n   \\nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \\n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \\n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \\n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \\n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can\\'t differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \\n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that\\'s a lot of data!).\\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \\n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \\n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \\n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don\\'t close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \\n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \\n\\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\\n\\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \\n\\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we\\'ll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\\n\\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are!

Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\\n\\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \\n\\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\\\left(1-exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-h}{ra}\\\\right)\\\\right)+n_{(0,\\\\infty)}\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\n    \\n2.

It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$. At this point, one can either compute the **spatial covariance**\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nC(k \\\\Delta h)=\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k\\\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nfrom which we can compute the **correlogram**, which is simply the spatial covariance normalized by the data variance (at $k=0$) so as to limit its range to $\\\\pm 1$,\\n\\n\\\\label{eq:corelogram}\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\rho(k \\\\Delta  h)=\\\\frac{C(k \\\\Delta h)}{C(0)}=\\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k \\\\Delta  h)d(x_i)}{\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^m(d(x_i)^2)}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nor look at the mean squared difference and form the **semivariogram**\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\gamma(k \\\\Delta  h)=\\\\frac{1}{2m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^m\\\\left(d(x_i+k\\\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\\\right)^2.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nThe functional forms $C(h)$, $\\\\rho(h)$ or $\\\\gamma(h)$ of these binned, discrete estimates is obtained simply by plotting $C(k\\\\Delta h)$, $\\\\rho(k\\\\Delta  h)$ or $\\\\gamma(k\\\\Delta  h)$ as a function of $k\\\\Delta h$ and by fitting a polynomial throught the results that ensures strictly positive values of $C(h)$, $\\\\rho(h)$ or $\\\\gamma(h)$ for any $h$.\\n\\nNote that the corelogram in geostatistics is very similar to the autocorrelation function used in time-series analysis.

Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\\n\\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \\n\\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\\\left(1-exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-h}{ra}\\\\right)\\\\right)+n_{(0,\\\\infty)}\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\n    \\n2.

It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$. At this point, one can either compute the **spatial covariance**\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nC(k \\\\Delta h)=\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k\\\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nfrom which we can compute the **correlogram**, which is simply the spatial covariance normalized by the data variance (at $k=0$) so as to limit its range to $\\\\pm 1$,\\n\\n\\\\label{eq:corelogram}\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\rho(k \\\\Delta  h)=\\\\frac{C(k \\\\Delta h)}{C(0)}=\\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k \\\\Delta  h)d(x_i)}{\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^m(d(x_i)^2)}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nor look at the mean squared difference and form the **semivariogram**\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\gamma(k \\\\Delta  h)=\\\\frac{1}{2m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^m\\\\left(d(x_i+k\\\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\\\right)^2.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nThe functional forms $C(h)$, $\\\\rho(h)$ or $\\\\gamma(h)$ of these binned, discrete estimates is obtained simply by plotting $C(k\\\\Delta h)$, $\\\\rho(k\\\\Delta  h)$ or $\\\\gamma(k\\\\Delta  h)$ as a function of $k\\\\Delta h$ and by fitting a polynomial throught the results that ensures strictly positive values of $C(h)$, $\\\\rho(h)$ or $\\\\gamma(h)$ for any $h$.\\n\\nNote that the corelogram in geostatistics is very similar to the autocorrelation function used in time-series analysis.

      "Source 1: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising approach to enhancing Explainable AI (XAI) by transforming complex machine learning outputs into easy-to-understand narratives, making model predictions more accessible to users, and helping bridge the gap between sophisticated model behavior and human interpretability. LLMs are an important link between complex AI models and XAI systems due to their natural language processing capabilities (Liu et al., 2023). For instance, (Bhattacharjee et al., 2024; Memon et al., 2024a) demonstrated the use of a simple prompting method to identify key features of an AI model’s predictions and generate counterfactual explanations using LLMs. This approach highlights the potential of LLMs to improve understanding and transparency in AI decision-making processes, making AI systems more interpretable and trustworthy across diverse fields.\n\nSource 2: Interpretable models outperform deep ones in a human generalization task. Data shifts reveal the limits of deep models on textual complexity tasks.\n\nSource 3: This study proposes to relate interpretability with the ability of a model to offer explanations of why a prediction is made given some point in feature space."

    "response": "The connection between **model interpretability** and the **ability to provide explanations** for predictions is critical in AI systems, particularly in domains where transparency and trust are essential. Here’s how the provided contexts support this relationship:\n\n   - **Context 1** highlights that **LLMs** (Large Language Models) act as a bridge between complex AI models and human-understandable explanations. By transforming opaque outputs into narratives, LLMs enable users to grasp why predictions are made, fostering **trust** and **interpretability**.  \n   - **Context 3** explicitly states that **interpretability** is directly tied to the model’s capacity to **explain** predictions in feature space. This aligns with the broader goal of making AI systems **transparent** and **trustworthy**.\n\n   - **Context 2** notes that **interpretable models** outperform **deep learning models** in human generalization tasks. This suggests that **higher interpretability** correlates with better performance in tasks requiring human-like reasoning, even when the model is complex.  \n   - **Context 1** also emphasizes that interpretable models (e.g., those using prompting methods) can **generate counterfactual explanations**, which are critical for understanding how predictions are derived.\n\n   - **Interpretability** is not just a theoretical concern but a **practical necessity** for deploying AI in real-world scenarios. For example:  \n     - **Context 1** shows that LLMs can simplify complex predictions, making them accessible to users.  \n     - **Context 3** underscores that models with strong interpretability can explain **why** predictions are made, which is vital for debugging, auditing, and ethical AI use.\n\n   - **Interpretability** is a **critical factor** in AI systems, as it directly impacts **user trust** and **system reliability**.  \n   - **Interpretable models** (e.g., those using LLMs or simpler architectures) can **generate clear explanations**, bridging the gap between complex models and human understanding.  \n   - **Context 2** reinforces that **interpretability** is not only a technical goal but also a **performance enhancer** in tasks requiring human-like reasoning.\n\nThe contexts collectively emphasize that **model interpretability** is foundational to **explanatory power** in AI systems. By enabling users to understand **why** predictions are made, interpretability ensures **trustworthiness**, **transparency**, and **performance** in both simple and complex models. This relationship is particularly important for applications in healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, where clarity and accountability are paramount.",

These are particularly useful when a process can take on a finite number of states, with varying probabilities. \\n\\nA system consisting of mutually exclusive states and probabilistic transitions between them is called a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) (after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov).\\n\\nThey are often linked to a technique called [`Markov Chain Monte Carlo`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo), which are a class of algorithms for sampling from a probability distribution. This is very useful for numerical error propagation. By constructing a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution, one can obtain a sample of the desired distribution by recording states from the chain. The [`Metropolis-Hastings algorightm`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis–Hastings_algorithm) is also key to certain non-linear global optimization algorithms, such as [`simulated annealing`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing). \\n\\nOne widely used analogy to explain Markov Chains is the 'drunken sailor' moving between his ship to the local pub (...the sailor being so drunk that he can move forwards, backwards, or not move at all):\\n\\n> [A drunken sailor moves from a tavern to his ship. The distance between the tavern and the ship is N steps. With each intermediate step, the sailor has chance **f** of stepping forward, chance **b** of stepping backward, and chance of **1-f-b** of standing still.

For instance, if we were to set q[0,0], this could mean that the sailor **is** (S[i]) in the tavern, and **going** to the tavern (S[j]), so he has not actually gone anywhere in this case, but the quantity q[i,j] let's us represent the probability of each move happeneing. In this case, from the tavern, the sailor cannot go backwards, only forwrads towards the ship, so q[0,0]=1-f (i.e. the probability of staying in the tavern is equal to the probability of *not* moving forward).\\n\\nImagine, we start with the state that the sailor **is** in the tavern, so we can say p[0]=1, and set all other p[i]=0. \\n\\nFrom that starting point, we can now imagine what happens during the next step, i.e. the sailor can either move one step forward (i.e. out of the tavern, i.e. p[0] would decrease and p[1] would increase), or stay in the tavern. Whatever happens, though, the drunken sailor has **no memory** of what he did last time...as he is drunk, so each new move is independent of the last move, in a memoryless fashion. \\n\\nThe fact that moves are memoryless does not mean that probabilities of being a state cannot be calculated between steps though. During the second step, the probability of being in step 2, p[2] will depend on wether the sailor was in p[1] or p[0] after step 1, and this depends on the probabilities of moving (q[i,j], which ultimately depends on probabilities **f** and **b** or moving forward and backwards, and on the probabilities of being somewhere (p[i]). \\n\\nTo calculate the probabilities of the sailor being in any given state at a given time step, we simply need to keep track of all probabilities of getting there (q) from each current state (p), and sum them. \\n\\n$\\np’[i] = sum(p[j] · q[j,i])\\n$\\n\\nFor example, for the mid-way state, N=2, equidistant between the ship and the tavern, the probability of being there, i.e. in the new state p'[2] from any previous state 'p', can be represented by:\\n\\n$\\np'[2] = q[0,2] · p[0] + q[1,2]· p[1] + q[2,2]· p[2] + q[3,2]· p[3] + q[4,2]· p[4]\\n$\\n\\nand given our knowledge of the probabilities, we can simplify this as: \\n\\n$\\np’[2] = 0 · p[0] + f · p[1] + (1-f-b) · p[2] + b · p[3] + 0 · p[4]\\n$\\n\\nWe get get to N=2 by moving from step 1 forward, moving from step 3 backwards, or not moving from step 2. We cannot get to step 2 directly from step 0 or 4 (the tavern or the ship) as this would requires two steps (the sailor can only make one step at a time). \\n\\nWe can apply the same logic and calculate the probablilites of being anywhere. For example, the probability of being in step 1, p'[1] would be: \\n\\n$\\np'[1]=q[0,1] · p[0] + q[1,1]· p[1] + q[2,1]· p[2] + q[3,1]· p[3] + q[4,1]· p[4] \\\\\\\\\\np’[1] = f · p[0] + (1-f-b) · p[1] + b · p[2] + 0 · p[3] + 0 · p[4]  \\n$\\n\\nThe 'ps' and the 'qs' for all cases can be quantified and arranged into matrices **'P'** and **'Q'**, such that $P' = P · Q$. **P** is the state matrix, while **Q** is called the **transition** matrix. In the case of N=4, we see that the matrices P and Q are 5x5, or N+1 x N+1. A Markovian system is one where all we know is the current state and transition probabilities, but we don't know (or keep track) of what the previous states were (they don't affect the transition probabilities).\\n\\n\\nMarkovian systems ultimately become stationary in the sense that the distribution of the probabilities of being in each state converge towards stable distributions. When that happens,  $P = P’ = P’’ = P’’’ = ... = π$, that is the probability matrix that sets the probability of being in each state no longer evolves with each new iteration (i.e. the distribution of the probabilities describing the likelihood of being in each state p[i] doesn't change anymore with more iterations).

    "response": "The key insights from the provided contexts revolve around **model resolution**, **experimental design**, and the **trade-offs** in climate modeling. Here's a structured summary:\n\n\n- **Trade-offs**:  \n  - **Spatial resolution** increases accuracy but demands more computational power (e.g., 2³ = 8x more computations for 2x spatial resolution in all dimensions).  \n  - **Temporal resolution** must be adjusted to maintain numerical stability (e.g., smaller time steps for higher resolution).  \n  - **Costs**: Higher resolution leads to significant increases in computational resources (memory, time, and energy).  \n\n- **Benefits**:  \n  - Improved **numerical accuracy** and **predictive power** for complex phenomena (e.g., cloud formation, ocean currents).  \n  - Enables finer-scale analysis of phenomena like regional climate patterns or extreme events.  \n\n\n- **Importance of Experimental Design**:  \n  - Careful planning is critical to isolate variables, control internal variability, and ensure **reproducibility**.  \n  - **Ensemble simulations** (e.g., Run 1, 2, 3) help quantify uncertainty by comparing model outputs under different conditions.  \n\n- **\"Metric\" in Climate Models**:  \n  - Balancing **internal variability** (natural climate processes) and **forced responses** (external forcings like CO₂).  \n  - Ensemble simulations are essential for assessing model reliability, as they account for natural variability and human-driven changes.  \n\n\n- **Numerical Diffusion**:  \n  - Models may introduce errors due to **numerical instability** (e.g., large time steps or poor parameterizations).  \n  - **Testing numerical cores** is critical to ensure accuracy, even without exact solutions.  \n\n- **Model Limitations**:  \n  - **Parameterizations** (e.g., cloud microphysics) are approximations that may limit accuracy.  \n  - **Modelers** must balance complexity with computational feasibility, prioritizing **practicality** over theoretical perfection.  \n\n\n- **Resolution**: Higher resolution improves accuracy but escalates computational costs.  \n- **Experimental Design**: Careful planning is vital to control variability and validate model outputs.  \n- **Trade-offs**: Balancing resolution, computational resources, and model complexity is central to climate modeling.  \n\nThis interplay between resolution, experimental design, and numerical stability underscores the challenges of building and",

Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\\n\\nYou\\'ll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \\n\\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \\n\\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \\n\\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\\n\\n## This segment of the module\\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\\n\\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \\nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \\nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\\n\\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\\n\\n\\n## We will focus and use climate data.\\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \\n\\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \\n___', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 0}}, {'id': 1753903424262111, 'score': 0.6158345, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_38_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='reanalysis'></a>\\n\\n# Reanalysis products\\n\\n![C3S](img/c3s-logo.png)\\n![ECMWF](img/logo-ecmwf.png) \\n\\n[*ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables.

It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally.

ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903968314666, 'score': 0.6157391, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_7_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"One can then use the arrays **X** and **Y** to directly evaluate functions over the entire grid, for example.\\n\\n**Note**: When working with model output, you may see that the latitudes an longitudes may be supplied either as vectors (**x,y**) or as two arrays (**X,Y**).

Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\\n\\nYou\\'ll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \\n\\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \\n\\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \\n\\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\\n\\n## This segment of the module\\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\\n\\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \\nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \\nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\\n\\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\\n\\n\\n## We will focus and use climate data.\\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \\n\\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \\n___', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 0}}, {'id': 1753903424159155, 'score': 0.6176214, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_44_code', 'type': 'code', 'content': 'import cdsapi\\n \\nc = cdsapi.Client(full_stack=True, debug=True)\\n \\nr = c.service(\"catalogue.retrieve\",\\n    \\'reanalysis-era5-single-levels\\',\\n    {\"variable\": \"2t\", \\n     \"product_type\": \"reanalysis\", \\n     \"date\": \"2021-01-01\", \\n     \"time\": \"14:00\"})\\n \\nr = c.service(\\'map.plot\\', r) # ask the Toolbox to make a map of the data\\n \\nr.download(\"output/ERA5_testmap.png\") # Check the output/ directory for a new map!', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 44}}, {'id': 1753903968231314, 'score': 0.6067943, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_39_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='example'></a>\\n# A nicer example!\\n## Making a map for research purposes (by Arianna Olivelli)\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 39}}]"

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753902299806645, 'score': 0.6489391, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_2', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' problem under study, etc.\\nWhat does a model need?A very simple numerical exampledCdt=λCCi+1−Citi+1−ti=λCiCi+1=Ci1+λΔt()dCdt=limΔt→0C(t+Δt)−C(t)ΔtRequires discretization of derivativesand numerical integration to step forward from tito tf=NDTForward difference(aka Forward Euler)[climatemodelsusemuchmorecomplex schemes]\\nii+1\\nWhat does a model need?Discretization needed to implement numericallydCdt=λCCi+1−CiΔt=λCi+1Ci+1=λΔtCi+1+CiCi+1=Ci11−λΔtBackward difference(aka backward Euler)Requires solving', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 2}}, {'id': 1753903424142956, 'score': 0.6436145, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_4_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='ESMValTool'></a>\\n\\n# Python environments to consider for working with climate data \\n\\n* ## Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool)\\n![esmvaltool](img/ESMValTool-logo-2.png)\\n\\nThis week, it should be possible to simply install packages as needed...\\n\\nHowever, if you anticipate possible future needs, you may want to invest a bit of effort to setup a specific python environment to work with climate data. If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753902702944729, 'score': 0.6341347, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_9', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'task.

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \\n\\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe (\\'18\\' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \\n\\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that\\'s a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \\n\\nAlthough UKCP18 is \\'just\\' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\\n\\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\\n\\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn\\'t contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \\n\\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\\n\\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \\n\\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\\n\\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \\nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \\n\\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \\n\\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \\n\\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \\n\\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\\n3. Output: Data only\\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\\n   \\nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \\n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \\n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \\n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \\n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can\\'t differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \\n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that\\'s a lot of data!).\\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \\n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \\n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \\n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don\\'t close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \\n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!).

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903424963171, 'score': 0.62312925, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_33_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '**Masks**: `Masks` are often used in climate science data to separate data from different regions (e.g. ocean vs land, etc.).

    "response": "The provided text discusses key aspects of climate modeling, data assimilation, and the limitations of climate models. Here's a structured summary of the main points:\n\n\n- **Model Incompleteness**: \n  - Models are \"incomplete\" and \"incomplete\" in their assumptions, making them \"wrong\" in some cases. They cannot perfectly replicate real-world phenomena (e.g., the effect of \"Z\" on climate, which may not be fully captured by simpler variables like \"W\").\n  - Models are not designed to \"reproduce data\" but to simulate processes with inherent uncertainties.\n\n- **Usefulness**:\n  - Models are **useful for understanding past and current climate patterns** (e.g., analyzing historical data, predicting variability) rather than forecasting future scenarios.\n  - They are **not suitable for forecasting** (e.g., predicting future climate changes) due to uncertainties in physics, parameterization, and external forcings (e.g., greenhouse gas concentrations).\n\n\n- **Model Parameters**:\n  - **Time steps**: Resolution of how frequently the model updates (e.g., daily, monthly).\n  - **Spatial resolution**: The granularity of the grid (e.g., high-resolution models for localized phenomena).\n  - **Integration scales**: Balancing temporal and spatial scales to avoid over-simplification or loss of detail.\n\n- **Model Physics**:\n  - **Discretization**: Numerical methods (e.g., forward Euler, backward Euler) are used to solve differential equations.\n  - **Simplifications**: Some physics (e.g., cloud microphysics, ocean-atmosphere coupling) are approximated or neglected to make models computationally feasible.\n\n\n- **Data Assimilation**:\n  - Techniques like **4DVAR** (four-dimensional variational analysis) are used to improve model predictions by incorporating observational data.\n  - Models are \"fitted\" to data, but this does not guarantee accuracy (e.g., \"fitted\" models may still produce unreliable results).\n\n- **Model-Data Comparison**:\n  - Models are compared to real-world data (e.g., satellite observations, weather forecasts) to assess their accuracy.\n  - **Key questions**: \n    - Are model outputs spatially and temporally similar to observational data?\n    - How well do models capture climate variability and trends?\n\n\n- **NetCDF**:\n  - A standard format for storing and managing climate data (e.g., model outputs, satellite data).\n  - Used for handling large datasets and metadata (e.g., spatial resolution, time intervals).\n\n- **Tools**:\n  - **NCO (NetCDF Operators)**: Tools for manipulating NetCDF files (e.g., merging datasets, extracting variables).\n  - **CDO (Climate Data Operators)**: Software for processing and analyzing climate data (e.g., calculating anomalies, trends).\n\n\n- **Applications**:\n  - **Climate research**: Understanding historical trends, impacts of greenhouse gases, and climate variability.\n  - **Policy-making**: Supporting decisions on adaptation and mitigation (e.g., IPCC reports).\n  - **Forecast",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\\n\\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \\n\\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\\n\\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable.

If the data represent a subset of a larger dataset, this should also be mentioned. \\n\\nAnother key pieces of information that the metadata should provide are a description of the variables in the file, with variable **names**, and the **units** of these variables. \\n\\nIf the data in the file represent a processed version of other raw data, then one should add information about these raw data as well, their provenance, references, and the transformation that was made, etc. One should be able to track the chain of information all the way to the orginal observations (or model output). \\n\\nIf the data represent gridded variables, then the nature of the grid on which these data are defined should also be explained. \\n\\nSimilarly, if the position, or some other features of the data, depend on a reference system, that reference system should be given. This will be discussed in more depth during the introduction to geostatistics lecture. \\n\\nIn the case of climate models (or other models, if relevant), the metadata should also include information about the model itself, the model name, version, the length of the integration, maybe a brief description of the spin-up, boundary conditions, initial conditions used to produce the simulation. \\n\\nObviously the information that will be included in the metadata vary substantially. You should learn (and will discover - mostly through shear frustration when key information is missing!) what constitute useful metadata in your field of work. \\n\\nMetadata can be included in the file itself (if the file format allows it), as separate files, or in the form of some other documents. When sourcing data, always make a note of where the data come from. This is especially true if getting data online as it is very easy to download data and then forget where they come from. Detailed note-taking is part of the job of the data analyst (and that of any scientist!). \\n\\nWhen metadata is included in the file directly, this typically comes as a header, or in a specified location in the file. The netCDF format has rules for how/where to include metadata, which is one of the reason why netCDF data are particularly useful and popular in climate science. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 9}}]",

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}]",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\\n\\n\\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)).

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753901957112878, 'score': 0.7098329, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_0', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30701Climate data and modelsEDSML MSc –Imperial College London –Environmental dataYves Plancherel-https://www.linkedin.com/in/yves-plancherel/\\nWhy discuss climate data and climate models?\\n1.

Metadata are not the data themselves, but are required to provide context and therefore inform the data analysis.** \\n\\nThere are two types of metadata, \"**discover metadata**\", which can be used to locate the dataset in a search, and \"**detailed metadata**\", which contain the information necessary to use the data (ideally) without having to ask the data provider for more information (even if one of the key piece of information should be the data provider information and contact detail!).\\n\\nThere is no upper limit as to what information should be included in the metadata, but typical metadata comprise information about when and where the observations, or the file, where produced, how they were produced (which instrument, technique, algorithm were used), information about the experiment the data come from, maybe some information about data accuracy (if not provided as seperate data in the file), information about who produced the data or the file, including contact information, or appropriate reference(s), and, if relevant, additional information about the research context, i.e. which project is associated with these data (this could help the user understand if more data from this group/project exist or can be expected). If the data represent a subset of a larger dataset, this should also be mentioned. \\n\\nAnother key pieces of information that the metadata should provide are a description of the variables in the file, with variable **names**, and the **units** of these variables. \\n\\nIf the data in the file represent a processed version of other raw data, then one should add information about these raw data as well, their provenance, references, and the transformation that was made, etc. One should be able to track the chain of information all the way to the orginal observations (or model output). \\n\\nIf the data represent gridded variables, then the nature of the grid on which these data are defined should also be explained. \\n\\nSimilarly, if the position, or some other features of the data, depend on a reference system, that reference system should be given. This will be discussed in more depth during the introduction to geostatistics lecture. \\n\\nIn the case of climate models (or other models, if relevant), the metadata should also include information about the model itself, the model name, version, the length of the integration, maybe a brief description of the spin-up, boundary conditions, initial conditions used to produce the simulation. \\n\\nObviously the information that will be included in the metadata vary substantially. You should learn (and will discover - mostly through shear frustration when key information is missing!) what constitute useful metadata in your field of work. \\n\\nMetadata can be included in the file itself (if the file format allows it), as separate files, or in the form of some other documents. When sourcing data, always make a note of where the data come from. This is especially true if getting data online as it is very easy to download data and then forget where they come from. Detailed note-taking is part of the job of the data analyst (and that of any scientist!). \\n\\nWhen metadata is included in the file directly, this typically comes as a header, or in a specified location in the file. The netCDF format has rules for how/where to include metadata, which is one of the reason why netCDF data are particularly useful and popular in climate science. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 9}}, {'id': 1753903424703434, 'score': 0.6880603, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_26_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"- **Attributes**: The last category of information required are 'attributes'.

While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page.

This series may be ordered in space (e.g. down a stratigraphic section) or in time (e.g. over the past 100 years). In either case, these are known as `time series`, and the term `time-series analysis` is used to describe the application of quantitative methods to discover patterns in the data. \\n\\nThe series variable can be defined either by a rank-order or by a quantitative measure of position along the series axis (time or space). To illustrate this, consider a tree rings.  A rank-order series is defined by the order that the rings appear, from inside to outside: first, second, third, ..., last.  A quantitative sequence measure, on the other hand, can be defined if each ring is dated, with ages: $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$, ..., $t_N$. (For tree rings, this is easy as one ring = one year.)\\n\\nA time-series consists of an observation at each entry in the rank-order or measured-time list.  This measurement can also be qualitative or quantitative.  As an example of the former, we might have a record of the presence or absence of a certain fossil-type in each layer of the stratigraphic sequence. The latter type of time-series, composed of quantitative observations, might be the height of water in a lake, the lateral displacement of a GPS station, or, in the case of tree rings, maybe the mass-fraction of a pollutant in the wood.\\n\\n[Time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series) data can be equally spaced or not, but if not, then extra care must be taken to analyze them. Time-series refer to sequence of discrete in time data. This also means that the points have a relationship with one-another, i.e some points cannot exist before, or after other points. That organization, containted in the order, can be exploited to learn more about real-world processes. \\n\\nData where time (or rank order, or sequential order) doesn't matter are sometimes called `cross sectional data`. These are sets of data observed at a single time, or where time has no meaning. \\n\\nTypically, time series data have the following form: \\n1. a time or index variable, or (when unlucky), multiple columns that have to be combined to create a meaningful time variable (this is often the case, when year, month, day, time, etc. are in different columns)\\n2. other columns of data with measurements/values of interest.\\n\\nNote that datasets can of course also contain [both cross-sectional and time series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsroWpkUuYI) information, in which case analysis can be performed for each time step, and across time steps, yielding for very rich analysis. For example, we could have data that measure the temporal evolution of some environmental variables in various locations. One could therefore compare locations spatially, at each time point, look at the evolution of the data at each station, and also do both. That is, time series analysis may not necessarily only concern 1D datasets, but also 2D, 3D, or ND datasets. \\n\\nIn general, we will consider time-series composed of $N$ entries indexed by an integer $i$ that goes from 1 to $N$.  For each value of $i$ we will have a measure of the position (e.g.~time), $t_i$, and a measure of some quantity at that time, $q_i$.  Hence a general time-series can be represented as\\n$\\n  t_1,\\\\, t_2,\\\\, t_3,\\\\,...,\\\\,t_{N-1},\\\\,t_N; \\\\\\\\\\n  q_1,\\\\, q_2,\\\\, q_3,\\\\,...,\\\\,q_{N-1},\\\\,q_N.\\n$\\n\\nA primary consideration in analysing a time-series is whether its entries are `regularly spaced`.  Regular spacing means that there is a constant difference between $t_{i+1}$ and $t_i$:\\n\\n$\\n  t_{i+1} - t_i = \\\\Delta t\\\\text{, const. for all }i.\\n$\\n\\nThe spacing between successive measurements, $\\\\Delta t$, could be a microsecond, or a metre, or a million years; the important point is that the same spacing applies to any pair of consecutive entries in the series.\\n\\nIf $\\\\Delta t$ is not constant, then interpolation methods can be used to interpolate the original data onto a constant grid, with constant spacing. \\n\\nThere are many ways to interpolate data, but not one best way. It is up to the analyst to pick the 'best' way and this will depend on the data distribution, data type, and on the research objectives. It is hard to know a-priori what works best for a given case and the analyst will need to check that her/his choice will not critically affect the conclusion of the study. \\n\\n`Linear interpolation` is often an excellent first choice.

This series may be ordered in space (e.g. down a stratigraphic section) or in time (e.g. over the past 100 years). In either case, these are known as `time series`, and the term `time-series analysis` is used to describe the application of quantitative methods to discover patterns in the data. \\n\\nThe series variable can be defined either by a rank-order or by a quantitative measure of position along the series axis (time or space). To illustrate this, consider a tree rings.  A rank-order series is defined by the order that the rings appear, from inside to outside: first, second, third, ..., last.  A quantitative sequence measure, on the other hand, can be defined if each ring is dated, with ages: $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$, ..., $t_N$. (For tree rings, this is easy as one ring = one year.)\\n\\nA time-series consists of an observation at each entry in the rank-order or measured-time list.  This measurement can also be qualitative or quantitative.  As an example of the former, we might have a record of the presence or absence of a certain fossil-type in each layer of the stratigraphic sequence. The latter type of time-series, composed of quantitative observations, might be the height of water in a lake, the lateral displacement of a GPS station, or, in the case of tree rings, maybe the mass-fraction of a pollutant in the wood.\\n\\n[Time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series) data can be equally spaced or not, but if not, then extra care must be taken to analyze them. Time-series refer to sequence of discrete in time data. This also means that the points have a relationship with one-another, i.e some points cannot exist before, or after other points. That organization, containted in the order, can be exploited to learn more about real-world processes. \\n\\nData where time (or rank order, or sequential order) doesn't matter are sometimes called `cross sectional data`. These are sets of data observed at a single time, or where time has no meaning. \\n\\nTypically, time series data have the following form: \\n1. a time or index variable, or (when unlucky), multiple columns that have to be combined to create a meaningful time variable (this is often the case, when year, month, day, time, etc. are in different columns)\\n2. other columns of data with measurements/values of interest.\\n\\nNote that datasets can of course also contain [both cross-sectional and time series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsroWpkUuYI) information, in which case analysis can be performed for each time step, and across time steps, yielding for very rich analysis. For example, we could have data that measure the temporal evolution of some environmental variables in various locations. One could therefore compare locations spatially, at each time point, look at the evolution of the data at each station, and also do both. That is, time series analysis may not necessarily only concern 1D datasets, but also 2D, 3D, or ND datasets. \\n\\nIn general, we will consider time-series composed of $N$ entries indexed by an integer $i$ that goes from 1 to $N$.  For each value of $i$ we will have a measure of the position (e.g.~time), $t_i$, and a measure of some quantity at that time, $q_i$.  Hence a general time-series can be represented as\\n$\\n  t_1,\\\\, t_2,\\\\, t_3,\\\\,...,\\\\,t_{N-1},\\\\,t_N; \\\\\\\\\\n  q_1,\\\\, q_2,\\\\, q_3,\\\\,...,\\\\,q_{N-1},\\\\,q_N.\\n$\\n\\nA primary consideration in analysing a time-series is whether its entries are `regularly spaced`.  Regular spacing means that there is a constant difference between $t_{i+1}$ and $t_i$:\\n\\n$\\n  t_{i+1} - t_i = \\\\Delta t\\\\text{, const. for all }i.\\n$\\n\\nThe spacing between successive measurements, $\\\\Delta t$, could be a microsecond, or a metre, or a million years; the important point is that the same spacing applies to any pair of consecutive entries in the series.\\n\\nIf $\\\\Delta t$ is not constant, then interpolation methods can be used to interpolate the original data onto a constant grid, with constant spacing. \\n\\nThere are many ways to interpolate data, but not one best way. It is up to the analyst to pick the 'best' way and this will depend on the data distribution, data type, and on the research objectives. It is hard to know a-priori what works best for a given case and the analyst will need to check that her/his choice will not critically affect the conclusion of the study. \\n\\n`Linear interpolation` is often an excellent first choice. It is simple and fast. However, because it relies on simply interpolating [between neighboring points using strait line segments](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter17.02-Linear-Interpolation.html), the interpolated product could be 'jagged'. Depending on the smoothness of the true process sampled by the time series, `higher-order polynomials` or `splines` could be used, or, as discuss later, a `loess/lowess` fit. \\n\\nPython provides many functions for **interpolation**, for instance from `scipy.interpolate`, such as [`interp1d`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.interp1d.html), [`interp2d`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.interp2d.html#scipy.interpolate.interp2d) for 2D grids for linear and bilinear interpolation, or [`UnivariateSpline`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline.html#scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline) or [`BivariateSpline`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.BivariateSpline.html#scipy.interpolate.BivariateSpline) for smoother options.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

    "response": "Here's a structured summary of the key points from the provided text about climate data and models:\n\n\n- **Importance of Data and Models**:  \n  - Climate models are essential for understanding variability (temporal, spatial) and uncertainties in climate projections.  \n  - Models must account for observational data to improve accuracy, but they often lack the resolution or detail of real-world observations.  \n  - **Key concepts**:  \n    - **Model Intercomparison Project (MIP)**: A global initiative to compare models across different scenarios.  \n    - **Data Assimilation**: Techniques like 4DVAR (Four-Dimensional Variational Analysis) blend model outputs with observational data to improve forecasts.  \n    - **Uncertainties**: Models are imperfect, and uncertainties arise from incomplete physics, parameter tuning, or computational limitations.  \n\n- **Role of Observations**:  \n  - Observations (e.g., satellite data, ground measurements) are critical for validating models and improving their accuracy.  \n  - Models may \"fit\" observations, but they remain approximations of reality.  \n\n\n- **Key Issues**:  \n  - **Model Limitations**:  \n    - **Microphysics**: Uncertainty in cloud formation and precipitation processes.  \n    - **Resolution**: Models often use coarse grids, making it difficult to capture small-scale phenomena (e.g., rainfall patterns).  \n    - **Parameter Tuning**: Model parameters are sometimes \"tuned\" to fit observations, but this can introduce biases.  \n  - **Data Assimilation**:  \n    - Balancing model predictions with observational data is complex.  \n    - **4DVAR** and other techniques aim to improve grid resolution and temporal accuracy.  \n\n- **Model vs. Observation**:  \n  - **Observations** are \"just\" data (e.g., temperature readings).  \n  - **Models** are \"just\" simulations, but they are \"assimilated\" with observations to improve forecasts.  \n\n\n- **ESMValTool**:  \n  - A community-driven tool for evaluating climate models.  \n  - Supports Python, Julia, R, and NCL.  \n  - Requires installation (e.g., via `mamba` for Linux) and access to large datasets (e.g., via ESGF, Earth System Grid Federation).  \n  - Focuses on **model diagnostics**, **uncertainty quantification**, and **data assimilation**.  \n\n- **Other Tools**:  \n  - **Climate Data Tools (CDT)**: For handling large datasets (e.g., CMIP6 data).  \n  - **Python Libraries**:  \n    - `xarray` for handling multi-dimensional datasets.  \n    - `pandas` for time-series analysis.  \n    - `matplotlib` for visualization.  \n\n- **Practical Considerations**:  \n  - **Experimental Design**: Careful planning is critical to minimize biases and ensure reproducibility.  \n  - **Data Access**: Large datasets (e.g., CMIP6) require cloud-based resources or institutional access.  \n\n\n- **Models are imperfect**: They require validation against observations and are subject to uncertainties.  \n- **Data is critical**: Observations and models must be reconciled to improve forecasts and projections.  \n- **Tools matter**: ESMValTool and other libraries are essential for working with climate data.  \n- **Ethical and Practical Challenges**: Balancing model accuracy with computational limits, and ensuring transparency in data assimilation.",

This latter statement could be translated as follows.\\n\\nJust as time-series were characterized by an autocorrelation function indicating that the values at time $t$ were not necessarily independent from previous values at times $t-\\\\tau$, points in space $(x_i,y_i)$ can also be thought of as correlated with any number of neighboring points $(x_k,y_k)$, $(x_l,y_l)$, etc. In time-series analysis and geostatistics, a Gauss-Markov regression model is a means of specifying the degree of correlation (i.e the memory) between neighboring points. The degree of influence that a point has on another point (i.e. the memory) is specified by means of a covariance matrix.

    "response": "Here's a structured summary of the key concepts and technical details from the provided contexts, focusing on **climate data handling, model resolution, and signal processing**:\n\n\n- **NetCDF (Network Common Data Form)** is a standard format for storing scientific data, particularly in climate research. It supports:\n  - **Self-describing data**: Metadata embedded in the file.\n  - **Portability**: Works across different hardware and software.\n  - **Scalability**: Efficiently handles large datasets.\n  - **Appendable**: Data can be added to existing files without redefining structure.\n  - **Sharable**: Multiple users can access the same file simultaneously.\n- **Python Integration**: The `netCDF4` library is commonly used for reading/writing NetCDF files. Example:  \n  ```python\n  import cdsapi\n  c = cdsapi.Client()\n  c.retrieve('reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels', {\n      'product_type': 'reanalysis',\n      'variable': 'temperature',\n      'pressure_level': '1000',\n      'year': '2021',\n      'month': '01',\n      'day': '01',\n      'time': '12:00',\n      'format': 'netcdf',\n      'area': [60., -11., 34., 35.],\n      'grid': [1.0, 1.0]\n  }, 'output/ERAtest_subarea_1deg1deg.nc')\n  ```\n\n\n- **Resolution Trade-offs**:\n  - **Spatial resolution**: Higher resolution increases computational cost (e.g., 2³ = 8x more calculations for 3 dimensions).\n  - **Temporal resolution**: To maintain stability, time steps must decrease when spatial resolution increases.\n- **Benefits**:\n  - Improved numerical accuracy with higher resolution.\n  - Better representation of small-scale phenomena (e.g., weather patterns).\n\n\n- **Nyquist Frequency**: Half of the sampling rate (e.g., 50 Hz for 100 Hz sampling). It represents the highest frequency that can be reliably captured from a discrete signal.\n- **DFT Application**: Used to analyze time series data. Example:  \n  ```python\n  # Dummy test (sampling rate = 100 Hz)\n  # Output shows symmetric frequencies at 50 Hz (Nyquist).\n  ```\n\n\n- **Masks**: Used to exclude data points (e.g., ocean vs. land). NetCDF files automatically mask values equal to `missing_value` or `_FillValue`.\n- **Handling Masks**:\n  - Use `Dataset.set_auto_mask()` to unmask all values.\n  - When writing masked arrays, values are filled with the `missing_value` from the file.\n\n\n- **NetCDF** is essential",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}]"

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753902703503123, 'score': 0.6615501, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_1', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'model cannot model the effect of “Z” on climate as “W” has or may have an (unquantified) effect of the “Z” and may effectCO2or T, etc. … therefore climate models are useless\\nSome better propositions1.All models are “wrong” and “incomplete”(modeling with the sole goal of fitting data can be futile)(state-or-the-art models have many free parameters, uniqueness of the fit/solution is not always guaranteed –fit for wrong reason possible)2.Models have the merit of being internally consistent and poss', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf', 'chunk_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753902299806645, 'score': 0.6614569, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_2', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' problem under study, etc.\\nWhat does a model need?A very simple numerical exampledCdt=λCCi+1−Citi+1−ti=λCiCi+1=Ci1+λΔt()dCdt=limΔt→0C(t+Δt)−C(t)ΔtRequires discretization of derivativesand numerical integration to step forward from tito tf=NDTForward difference(aka Forward Euler)[climatemodelsusemuchmorecomplex schemes]\\nii+1\\nWhat does a model need?Discretization needed to implement numericallydCdt=λCCi+1−CiΔt=λCi+1Ci+1=λΔtCi+1+CiCi+1=Ci11−λΔtBackward difference(aka backward Euler)Requires solving', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 2}}, {'id': 1753902300472417, 'score': 0.65892506, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_1', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ng physics)What are they for climate?\\nWhat does a model need?A very simple analytical exampleMany equations cannot be solved analytically…What do we have to do to solve them numerically?\\nii+1i+2…i-1i-2…Applies to time + 3D space\\nDiscretization\\nii+1i+2…i-1i-2…Applies to time + 3D spacedCdt=limΔt→0C(t+Δt)−C(t)ΔtdCdt≈C(t+Δt)−C(t)Δt,Δt>0ContinuumDiscrete(Taylor series expansion)\\nInpractice, this implies choices of Dx, Dy, Dz, Dt, size of the stencil, numerical stability, computational ability/costs,', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 1}}]",

    "response": "The provided text focuses on **climate modeling**, particularly **model resolution**, **numerical methods**, and **validation against real-world data**. Key concepts and trade-offs are highlighted as follows:\n\n\n- **Resolution Trade-offs**: \n  - Higher spatial resolution (e.g., 2x2x2 grid cells) increases computational costs exponentially. For example, a 2x2x2 grid requires 8x more computations and 8x more memory than a coarser grid.\n  - **Impact**: Higher resolution improves accuracy but demands significant computational resources, limiting the scale and duration of simulations.\n\n\n- **Discretization**: \n  - Models approximate continuous systems using discrete steps (e.g., finite differences). This involves:\n    - **Forward Euler** (simplest method): $ \\frac{dC}{dt} \\approx \\lambda C_{i+1} - C_i $.\n    - **Backward Euler**: Solves $ C_{i+1} = \\lambda C_{i+1} + C_i $, requiring iterative steps.\n  - **Complex Schemes**: Climatemodels use advanced schemes (e.g., implicit methods) to improve stability and accuracy, though they are computationally more demanding.\n\n\n- **Challenges**:\n  - Models struggle to replicate real-world data due to:\n    - **Incomplete understanding of microphysics** (e.g., cloud formation).\n    - **Uncertainty in predicting events** (e.g., rain distribution, temperature gradients).\n  - **Value of Models**: Even imperfect, models provide critical insights into climate systems, helping refine predictions and validate hypotheses.\n\n\n- **Importance of Experimental Design**:\n  - Careful planning (e.g., controlling variables, using ensembles) is essential to isolate effects and assess model reliability.\n  - **Uncertainty**: Models must account for:\n    - **Resolution limitations**.\n    - **Parameterization errors**.\n    - **External forcings** (e.g., greenhouse gas concentrations).\n\n\n- **Balancing Accuracy and Cost**: \n  - Models must balance resolution and computational resources, often prioritizing key variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation) over full-resolution simulations.\n- **Use of Model Outputs**: \n  - Even imperfect models are vital for:\n    - **Scenario analysis** (e.g., \"what if CO2 doubles?\").\n    - **Pattern identification** (e.g., regional climate trends).\n\n\nThe text underscores the **trade-offs between model resolution and computational cost**, the **importance of numerical accuracy**, and the **challenges of validating models against real-world data**. While models are imperfect, they remain indispensable tools for understanding and predicting climate systems. Key considerations include:\n- **Resolution vs. performance**.\n- **Numerical stability and accuracy**.\n- **Experimental design and uncertainty**.\n- **Model outputs as a basis for further analysis**.",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}]",

    "response": "The provided context discusses key concepts in climate modeling, experimental design, and the challenges of uncertainty in numerical simulations. Here's a structured summary of the main ideas:\n\n   - **Control+Experiment Approach**: To isolate the effects of variables (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions), control experiments are used alongside simulations. This helps quantify uncertainties and validate model responses.  \n   - **Ensemble Simulations**: Multiple simulations with slight variations (e.g., initial conditions, parameters) are run to account for natural variability and model uncertainties. This is critical for assessing how models perform under different scenarios.\n\n   - **Sources of Uncertainty**:  \n     - **Numerical Errors**: Discretization (grid resolution), time-stepping, and algorithmic limitations can introduce errors.  \n     - **Parameterizations**: Simplified representations of processes (e.g., clouds, ocean currents) may miss subgrid-scale details, leading to inaccuracies.  \n     - **Resolution**: Higher resolution improves accuracy but increases computational cost. Lower resolution may miss local extremes or dynamic features.  \n   - **Model Limitations**:  \n     - Models are inherently imperfect, and their performance depends on the quality of data, parameterizations, and initial conditions.  \n     - Balancing simplicity (to reduce computational costs) with accuracy is a trade-off.\n\n   - **Equations and Parameterizations**:  \n     - Models rely on numerical solutions to dynamical equations (e.g., Navier-Stokes, energy balance).  \n     - Parameterizations resolve subgrid processes (e.g., eddies, overflows) while simplifying larger-scale phenomena.  \n   - **Resolution and Resolution Trade-offs**:  \n     - Higher resolution captures finer details (e.g., local weather patterns) but requires more data and computational power.  \n     - Lower resolution sacrifices spatial or temporal resolution, potentially missing critical dynamics.\n\n   - **Metrics and Validation**:  \n     - Model performance is assessed using metrics like mean surface temperature anomalies, but comparisons across ensembles are essential.  \n     - The \"best model\" is context-dependent; simpler models may work well for certain tasks (e.g., regional analysis) but may lack accuracy for global-scale processes.  \n   - **Interpretation of Uncertainties**:  \n     - Probabilistic answers are often necessary due to inherent model limitations.  \n     - Internal variability (natural climate fluctuations) and \"forced\" responses (anthropogenic impacts) must be distinguished to avoid misinterpretation.\n\n   - **Data Analysis**:  \n     - Tools must account for data limitations (e.g., sparse observations) and environmental dynamics.  \n     - Techniques like ensemble simulations and sensitivity analyses help quantify uncertainties.  \n   - **Numerical Methods**:  \n     - Models must balance accuracy with computational efficiency, addressing issues like numerical diffusion (loss of sharpness in solutions).\n\n   - **Control Experiments**: Crucial for isolating the impact of variables (e.g., CO₂ emissions) and validating model responses.  \n   - **Ensemble Simulations**: Provide robust estimates of uncertainty by averaging over multiple scenarios.  \n   - **Data-Driven Insights**: High-quality data (e.g., satellite, in situ measurements) improve model accuracy and reduce uncertainties.\n\n- **Models are imperfect** but can be made useful through careful design, ensemble analysis, and validation.  \n- **Experimental design** (control + ensemble simulations) is vital for understanding model behavior and uncertainties.  \n- **Balancing resolution, parameterizations, and computational cost** is central",

    "response": "A numerical model in climate science requires a comprehensive set of components to accurately simulate Earth's climate systems. These include:\n\n   - **Fundamental Equations**: Solve partial differential equations (PDEs) governing fluid dynamics (e.g., Navier-Stokes), heat transfer, radiation, and mass conservation.  \n   - **Parameterizations**: Approximate subgrid processes (e.g., cloud formation, convection, ocean currents) using empirical or semi-empirical models.  \n   - **Coupling**: Integrate atmospheric, oceanic, land, and ice components (e.g., atmosphere-ocean interaction, land surface processes).\n\n   - **Spatial Resolution**: Grid size (Dx, Dy, Dz) determines the resolution of the model (e.g., 1° latitude/longitude for global models).  \n   - **Temporal Resolution**: Time step (Dt) balances accuracy and computational cost. Higher resolution requires smaller steps but increases computational demands.  \n   - **Stencils**: Choose appropriate grid structures (e.g., structured vs. unstructured) and numerical schemes (e.g., finite difference, finite element) for stability and accuracy.\n\n   - **Initial Conditions**: Start with known states (e.g., historical climate data or simulations).  \n   - **Boundary Conditions**: Define edges of the model domain (e.g., ocean boundaries, land-ice interfaces) and external forcings (e.g., greenhouse gas concentrations, solar radiation).\n\n   - **Stability**: Use schemes that maintain numerical stability (e.g., implicit methods for ocean models).  \n   - **Accuracy**: Balance computational cost with precision (e.g., adaptive time steps, higher-order schemes for certain processes).\n\n   - **Resolution Trade-offs**: Higher resolution increases computational",

    "response": "The provided texts focus on **climate modeling**, **data retrieval**, and **grid resolution** in climate datasets, particularly using the **Climate Data Store (CDS)** API. Here's a structured summary of the key points:\n\n\n- **Core Components**:\n  - **Equations**: Models require mathematical formulations (e.g., `dC/dt = λC_i+1 - C_i`) to simulate physical processes (e.g., ocean currents, atmospheric dynamics).\n  - **Grid Resolution**: Models use grids (e.g., 0.25°x0.25° for atmosphere, 0.5°x0.5° for ocean waves) to discretize spatial domains. Higher resolution (e.g., 1°x1°) is often used for detailed simulations.\n  - **Coupling**: Models integrate atmospheric, oceanic, and land components (e.g., Gulf Stream, Labrador Sea) to simulate climate systems.\n\n\n- **Key Parameters**:\n  - **`product_type`**: \"reanalysis\" (e.g., ERA5, ERA-Interim).\n  - **`variable`**: Specific data (e.g., temperature, pressure).\n  - **`pressure_level`**: Specifies the vertical resolution (e.g., 1000 hPa for temperature).\n  - **`area`**: Defines geographic region (e.g., [60°N, -11°E, 34°N, 35°E] for Europe).\n  - **`grid`**: Adjusts spatial resolution (e.g., [1.0, 1.0] for 1°x1° grid).\n\n- **Example Script**:\n  ```python\n  import cdsapi\n  c = cdsapi.Client()\n  c.retrieve(\n      'reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels',\n      {\n          'product_type': 'reanalysis',\n          'variable': 'temperature',\n          'pressure_level': '1000',\n          'year': '2021',\n          'month': '01',\n          'day': '01',\n          'time': '12:00',\n          'format': 'netcdf',\n          'area': [60., -11., 34., 35.],\n          'grid': [1.0, 1.0]\n      },\n      'output/ERAtest_subarea_1deg1deg.nc'\n  )\n  ```\n  - **Output**: A NetCDF file with reduced resolution (1°x1°) for specific regions (e.g., Europe).\n\n\n- **Low vs. High Resolution**:\n  - **Low-resolution** (e.g., 1°x1°): Suitable for regional studies, reduces computational burden.\n  - **High-resolution** (e.g., 0.25°x0.25°): Provides finer details (e.g., ocean eddies, air-se",

Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}, {'id': 1753902300472417, 'score': 0.60768396, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_1', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ng physics)What are they for climate?\\nWhat does a model need?A very simple analytical exampleMany equations cannot be solved analytically…What do we have to do to solve them numerically?\\nii+1i+2…i-1i-2…Applies to time + 3D space\\nDiscretization\\nii+1i+2…i-1i-2…Applies to time + 3D spacedCdt=limΔt→0C(t+Δt)−C(t)ΔtdCdt≈C(t+Δt)−C(t)Δt,Δt>0ContinuumDiscrete(Taylor series expansion)\\nInpractice, this implies choices of Dx, Dy, Dz, Dt, size of the stencil, numerical stability, computational ability/costs,', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903968752811, 'score': 0.60728157, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_21_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='fitting'></a>\\n# Surface fitting\\n\\nThe interpolation techniques described above work very well when the space is relatively well-sampled, when one does not want to extrapolate beyond the convex hull and in the absence of variability or uncertainties associated the control points. If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\\n\\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \\n\\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement.

    "response": "The text discusses key concepts in numerical modeling, interpolation, and geostatistics, emphasizing the importance of mathematical formulations, numerical stability, and advanced techniques like kriging. Below is a structured summary of the core ideas:\n\n\n- **Equations and Parameters**: \n  - Models require equations (e.g., partial differential equations) and parameterizations to relate inputs to outputs (e.g., `F(x, t) = function(input)`).\n  - **Starting Points**: Boundary conditions and initial values are critical for model validity.\n  - **Time and Space**: Time and spatial domains must be defined explicitly (e.g., `t` and `x`, `y`, `z`).\n\n- **Discretization**:\n  - Models are discretized into grids (e.g., `xx, yy` in 2D) to approximate continuous functions.\n  - **Stencils and Stability**: Choices like `Dx, Dy, Dz` (grid spacing) and numerical schemes (e.g., forward, backward, or centered differences) affect accuracy and stability.\n\n- **Numerical Diffusion**:\n  - Different schemes have trade-offs: forward schemes (e.g., forward difference) may introduce diffusion, while centered schemes (e.g., finite differences) are more accurate but require more computational resources.\n\n\n- **Grid Data Interpolation**:\n  - Tools like `scipy.interpolate.griddata` interpolate scattered data (e.g., `z` values at random points `(xx, yy)`) to create smooth surfaces.\n  - Example: `griddata((xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()), z.ravel(), (newx[None, :], newy[:, None]))` generates a 2D grid from sample data.\n\n- **Kriging (Geostatistics)**:\n  - A statistical method for spatial interpolation, pioneered by **Danie G. Krige** and formalized by **Georges Matheron**.\n  - **Key Principles**:\n    - **Optimal Interpolation**: Minimizes misfit errors by weighting sample points based on their spatial correlation (e.g., using a covariance matrix).\n    - **Smoothing**: Results are smoother than raw data, accounting for noise and variability.\n    - **Covariance Matrix**: Subjective choices (e.g., defining the covariance structure) influence the final surface.\n  - **Advantages**:\n    - Accounts for spatial dependencies, reducing errors from random noise.\n    - Provides uncertainty estimates (e.g., through kriging variance).\n\n\n- **Numerical Stability**:\n  - Forward schemes (e.g., forward difference) may introduce diffusion, while centered schemes (e.g., finite differences) are more accurate but computationally intensive.\n  - Testing models against known solutions (e.g., `np.sin` in",

In that case, the computer can very efficiently calculate differences between neighboring points, such as $x(i+1)-x(i)$, with these differences having meaning (e.g. a finite difference). This is not the case in scattered datasets where there is no obvious connection between the i$^{th}$ data point and the i$^{th}$+1 or i$^{th}$-1 sample.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753903424959234, 'score': 0.65074646, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_9_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '<a id=\\'Metadata\\'></a>\\n\\n## The importance of Metadata\\n[Metadata](https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/4428-metadata-basics) **relate to all the information necessary to interpret, understand and use a given dataset. Metadata are not the data themselves, but are required to provide context and therefore inform the data analysis.** \\n\\nThere are two types of metadata, \"**discover metadata**\", which can be used to locate the dataset in a search, and \"**detailed metadata**\", which contain the information necessary to use the data (ideally) without having to ask the data provider for more information (even if one of the key piece of information should be the data provider information and contact detail!).\\n\\nThere is no upper limit as to what information should be included in the metadata, but typical metadata comprise information about when and where the observations, or the file, where produced, how they were produced (which instrument, technique, algorithm were used), information about the experiment the data come from, maybe some information about data accuracy (if not provided as seperate data in the file), information about who produced the data or the file, including contact information, or appropriate reference(s), and, if relevant, additional information about the research context, i.e. which project is associated with these data (this could help the user understand if more data from this group/project exist or can be expected). If the data represent a subset of a larger dataset, this should also be mentioned. \\n\\nAnother key pieces of information that the metadata should provide are a description of the variables in the file, with variable **names**, and the **units** of these variables. \\n\\nIf the data in the file represent a processed version of other raw data, then one should add information about these raw data as well, their provenance, references, and the transformation that was made, etc. One should be able to track the chain of information all the way to the orginal observations (or model output). \\n\\nIf the data represent gridded variables, then the nature of the grid on which these data are defined should also be explained. \\n\\nSimilarly, if the position, or some other features of the data, depend on a reference system, that reference system should be given. This will be discussed in more depth during the introduction to geostatistics lecture. \\n\\nIn the case of climate models (or other models, if relevant), the metadata should also include information about the model itself, the model name, version, the length of the integration, maybe a brief description of the spin-up, boundary conditions, initial conditions used to produce the simulation. \\n\\nObviously the information that will be included in the metadata vary substantially. You should learn (and will discover - mostly through shear frustration when key information is missing!) what constitute useful metadata in your field of work. \\n\\nMetadata can be included in the file itself (if the file format allows it), as separate files, or in the form of some other documents. When sourcing data, always make a note of where the data come from. This is especially true if getting data online as it is very easy to download data and then forget where they come from. Detailed note-taking is part of the job of the data analyst (and that of any scientist!). \\n\\nWhen metadata is included in the file directly, this typically comes as a header, or in a specified location in the file. The netCDF format has rules for how/where to include metadata, which is one of the reason why netCDF data are particularly useful and popular in climate science. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 9}}, {'id': 1753903424602740, 'score': 0.6468509, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_34_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '**Time coordinates**: The time coordinate ofen poses a special challenge when working with environmental data.

CF Conventions advocate for a measure of time given relative to a fixed data and using a defined calendar, and given in the YY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss format. \\n\\nThe `cftime` and `datetime` packages provide functions to decode time units and variable values from a netCDF file, if that file conforms to CF Conventions.

There are various python implementations of these techniques. Note that applying these typically requires regularly spaced data. \\n\\nThis [site](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter24.01-The-Basics-of-waves.html) provides an excellent resource to learn more about numerical implementations of Fourier transforms and inverse Fourier transforms in python.\\n\\nThe main thing to remember, from a practical perspective, is to use the **Fourier transform to go from the time to the frequency domain**, and the **inverse Fourier Transform to go from frequency domain back to the time domain**. \\n\\nBy transforming a signal in the time domain into the frequency domain, we aim to decompose the signal into its dominant fequencies. We can then measure the magnitude of these fequencies, i.e. how important they are, that is how much they contribute to the overall signal.

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903968777554, 'score': 0.61653256, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_23_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '#### Mathematical formulation (only the basic setup of the problem, not the solution)\\n\\nThe general problem is to compute an estimate $\\\\hat{F}(\\\\vec{x}_0,t)$ of the true field $F(\\\\vec{x}_0,t)$ at query position $\\\\vec{x}_0$ from a finite number of scattered observations $f(\\\\vec{x}_n,t)$ taken at locations $\\\\vec{x}_n$, with $n=1,2,...,N$.\\n\\nIf we consider a snap-shot in time, i.e. dropping the time index $t$, the generalized kriging problem can be stated as\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\hat{F}(\\\\vec{x}_0)=\\\\overline{F(\\\\vec{x})}+\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^Nb(x_i)(f(x_i)-\\\\overline{f(x_i)})\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nwhere the overbars denote the expectation value (i.e. the mean) and the $b(x_i)$ are yet unspecified weighting coefficients for each data point $x_i$, subject to $\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^Nb(x_i)=1$.\\n\\nThe generalized kriging problem equation above means that to predict the value of the field $\\\\hat{F}(\\\\vec{x}_0)$ at a query location $\\\\vec{x}_0$, a good guess is to start with the mean (or some known structure) of the overall field $\\\\overline{F(\\\\vec{x})}$, to which we add corrections.

The big question is what values should the weight corresponding to each sample have? Answering this question is not easy - it is basically the whole point of kriging. The answer will depend on any additional constraints that one applies on these weights and on any additional properties one wishes the field $F$ or $D$ to have (stationarity of various moments, isotropy, etc.). Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}, {'id': 1753903968752811, 'score': 0.6121623, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_21_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='fitting'></a>\\n# Surface fitting\\n\\nThe interpolation techniques described above work very well when the space is relatively well-sampled, when one does not want to extrapolate beyond the convex hull and in the absence of variability or uncertainties associated the control points.

These are particularly useful when a process can take on a finite number of states, with varying probabilities. \\n\\nA system consisting of mutually exclusive states and probabilistic transitions between them is called a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) (after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov).\\n\\nThey are often linked to a technique called [`Markov Chain Monte Carlo`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo), which are a class of algorithms for sampling from a probability distribution.

The distance between the tavern and the ship is N steps.

For instance, if we were to set q[0,0], this could mean that the sailor **is** (S[i]) in the tavern, and **going** to the tavern (S[j]), so he has not actually gone anywhere in this case, but the quantity q[i,j] let's us represent the probability of each move happeneing. In this case, from the tavern, the sailor cannot go backwards, only forwrads towards the ship, so q[0,0]=1-f (i.e. the probability of staying in the tavern is equal to the probability of *not* moving forward).\\n\\nImagine, we start with the state that the sailor **is** in the tavern, so we can say p[0]=1, and set all other p[i]=0. \\n\\nFrom that starting point, we can now imagine what happens during the next step, i.e. the sailor can either move one step forward (i.e. out of the tavern, i.e. p[0] would decrease and p[1] would increase), or stay in the tavern. Whatever happens, though, the drunken sailor has **no memory** of what he did last time...as he is drunk, so each new move is independent of the last move, in a memoryless fashion. \\n\\nThe fact that moves are memoryless does not mean that probabilities of being a state cannot be calculated between steps though. During the second step, the probability of being in step 2, p[2] will depend on wether the sailor was in p[1] or p[0] after step 1, and this depends on the probabilities of moving (q[i,j], which ultimately depends on probabilities **f** and **b** or moving forward and backwards, and on the probabilities of being somewhere (p[i]). \\n\\nTo calculate the probabilities of the sailor being in any given state at a given time step, we simply need to keep track of all probabilities of getting there (q) from each current state (p), and sum them. \\n\\n$\\np’[i] = sum(p[j] · q[j,i])\\n$\\n\\nFor example, for the mid-way state, N=2, equidistant between the ship and the tavern, the probability of being there, i.e. in the new state p'[2] from any previous state 'p', can be represented by:\\n\\n$\\np'[2] = q[0,2] · p[0] + q[1,2]· p[1] + q[2,2]· p[2] + q[3,2]· p[3] + q[4,2]· p[4]\\n$\\n\\nand given our knowledge of the probabilities, we can simplify this as: \\n\\n$\\np’[2] = 0 · p[0] + f · p[1] + (1-f-b) · p[2] + b · p[3] + 0 · p[4]\\n$\\n\\nWe get get to N=2 by moving from step 1 forward, moving from step 3 backwards, or not moving from step 2. We cannot get to step 2 directly from step 0 or 4 (the tavern or the ship) as this would requires two steps (the sailor can only make one step at a time). \\n\\nWe can apply the same logic and calculate the probablilites of being anywhere. For example, the probability of being in step 1, p'[1] would be: \\n\\n$\\np'[1]=q[0,1] · p[0] + q[1,1]· p[1] + q[2,1]· p[2] + q[3,1]· p[3] + q[4,1]· p[4] \\\\\\\\\\np’[1] = f · p[0] + (1-f-b) · p[1] + b · p[2] + 0 · p[3] + 0 · p[4]  \\n$\\n\\nThe 'ps' and the 'qs' for all cases can be quantified and arranged into matrices **'P'** and **'Q'**, such that $P' = P · Q$. **P** is the state matrix, while **Q** is called the **transition** matrix. In the case of N=4, we see that the matrices P and Q are 5x5, or N+1 x N+1. A Markovian system is one where all we know is the current state and transition probabilities, but we don't know (or keep track) of what the previous states were (they don't affect the transition probabilities).\\n\\n\\nMarkovian systems ultimately become stationary in the sense that the distribution of the probabilities of being in each state converge towards stable distributions. When that happens,  $P = P’ = P’’ = P’’’ = ... = π$, that is the probability matrix that sets the probability of being in each state no longer evolves with each new iteration (i.e. the distribution of the probabilities describing the likelihood of being in each state p[i] doesn't change anymore with more iterations).

    "response": "The provided content focuses on time series analysis, specifically using **random walks** and **seasonality** to create synthetic time series data. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and steps:\n\n\n- **Definition**: A random walk is a stochastic process where each step is independent and random. In time series, it models data where each value is the previous value plus a random noise term (e.g., a Gaussian distribution with fixed variance).\n- **Example**: \n  ```python\n  random_walk1 = np.cumsum(np.random.randn(nhours))\n  ```\n  This creates a sequence where each point is the sum of all previous random steps.\n\n\n- **Addition**: To introduce periodic patterns (e.g., yearly cycles), sine waves are added to the random walk.\n- **Implementation**:\n  ```python\n  period = 365  # One year\n  omega = 2 * np.pi / period  # Angular frequency\n  phase_shift = 365 / 4  # Phase shift for summer (high) and winter (low)\n  periodic_element = Amplitude * np.sin(omega * (t - phase_shift))\n  ```\n  This creates a sine wave with a period of 1 year, modulated by a phase shift to simulate seasonal variation.\n\n\n- **Combination**: The periodic element is added to the random walk to create a **periodic walk** (e.g., a combination of random fluctuations and seasonal cycles).\n- **Result**: The final `periodic_walk1` combines the random walk's noise with the sine wave's periodicity, producing a time series with both stochastic and cyclical behavior.\n\n\n- **Stationary Data**: \n  - Mean and variance are constant over time.\n  - Example: A random walk with a fixed variance is **non-stationary**",

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424623019, 'score': 0.63508856, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_37_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"### Climate Data Operators (CDO)\\nThe Climate Data Operators ([CDO](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo)) software is a collection of >600 operators for standard processing of climate and forecast model data.

For any given query point $\\\\vec{x}_0$, the necessary correction is calcuated as a weighted sum of contributions from the available samples $x_i$. The big question is what values should the weight corresponding to each sample have? Answering this question is not easy - it is basically the whole point of kriging. The answer will depend on any additional constraints that one applies on these weights and on any additional properties one wishes the field $F$ or $D$ to have (stationarity of various moments, isotropy, etc.). Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}, {'id': 1753902703226725, 'score': 0.61709404, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_13', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' model do it all?Processes operate on various time/space scales\\nHigher resolution•(more data)•(local extremes)•(shorter simulation)•(no/few ensembles)Lower resolution•(fewer data)•(longer simulation)•(many ensembles)\\n\\nTake home messages•Models will always be imperfect (accept this!)–the challenge is to make them useful by keeping them as simple as possible in spite oftheir limitations •very difficult in practice, requires deep scientific knowledge•Understanding of the question and of the tools a', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf', 'chunk_number': 13}}, {'id': 1753907767204658, 'score': 0.6170291, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_timeseriesanalysis-IC-X9CYXD36RX.ipynb_cell_5_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='practice'></a>\\n## Practicing with stationarity and detrending\\n\\nAs an example, let's first create a few synthetic time series, using a `random walk` model, i.e. a sequence of random points, with a given variance, but that are uncorrelated from point to point.

Metadata are not the data themselves, but are required to provide context and therefore inform the data analysis.** \\n\\nThere are two types of metadata, \"**discover metadata**\", which can be used to locate the dataset in a search, and \"**detailed metadata**\", which contain the information necessary to use the data (ideally) without having to ask the data provider for more information (even if one of the key piece of information should be the data provider information and contact detail!).\\n\\nThere is no upper limit as to what information should be included in the metadata, but typical metadata comprise information about when and where the observations, or the file, where produced, how they were produced (which instrument, technique, algorithm were used), information about the experiment the data come from, maybe some information about data accuracy (if not provided as seperate data in the file), information about who produced the data or the file, including contact information, or appropriate reference(s), and, if relevant, additional information about the research context, i.e. which project is associated with these data (this could help the user understand if more data from this group/project exist or can be expected). If the data represent a subset of a larger dataset, this should also be mentioned. \\n\\nAnother key pieces of information that the metadata should provide are a description of the variables in the file, with variable **names**, and the **units** of these variables. \\n\\nIf the data in the file represent a processed version of other raw data, then one should add information about these raw data as well, their provenance, references, and the transformation that was made, etc. One should be able to track the chain of information all the way to the orginal observations (or model output). \\n\\nIf the data represent gridded variables, then the nature of the grid on which these data are defined should also be explained. \\n\\nSimilarly, if the position, or some other features of the data, depend on a reference system, that reference system should be given. This will be discussed in more depth during the introduction to geostatistics lecture. \\n\\nIn the case of climate models (or other models, if relevant), the metadata should also include information about the model itself, the model name, version, the length of the integration, maybe a brief description of the spin-up, boundary conditions, initial conditions used to produce the simulation. \\n\\nObviously the information that will be included in the metadata vary substantially. You should learn (and will discover - mostly through shear frustration when key information is missing!) what constitute useful metadata in your field of work. \\n\\nMetadata can be included in the file itself (if the file format allows it), as separate files, or in the form of some other documents. When sourcing data, always make a note of where the data come from. This is especially true if getting data online as it is very easy to download data and then forget where they come from. Detailed note-taking is part of the job of the data analyst (and that of any scientist!). \\n\\nWhen metadata is included in the file directly, this typically comes as a header, or in a specified location in the file. The netCDF format has rules for how/where to include metadata, which is one of the reason why netCDF data are particularly useful and popular in climate science. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 9}}, {'id': 1753901956989969, 'score': 0.636999, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_2', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g.calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).Learning objectives of the Environmental Data module•Growing/important field –with likely career opportunities•Great playground to deliver learning objectives\\nUsing climate models: quantification/forecasting(impacts, adaptation, mitigation)\\nhttps://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts\\nUsing climate models: designscenarios(explore policy,', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf', 'chunk_number': 2}}, {'id': 1753902702794239, 'score': 0.633574, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_8', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'cool and warm the climateThe microphysics responsible for cloud formation is not well understoodThe grid cells in models are much much bigger than time/space scales relevant for cloud physicsÞMagnitude/location of rain events is hard to predict wellÞThat information is useful though!\\nComparing models with data•What is a data point?

This series may be ordered in space (e.g. down a stratigraphic section) or in time (e.g. over the past 100 years). In either case, these are known as `time series`, and the term `time-series analysis` is used to describe the application of quantitative methods to discover patterns in the data. \\n\\nThe series variable can be defined either by a rank-order or by a quantitative measure of position along the series axis (time or space). To illustrate this, consider a tree rings.  A rank-order series is defined by the order that the rings appear, from inside to outside: first, second, third, ..., last.  A quantitative sequence measure, on the other hand, can be defined if each ring is dated, with ages: $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$, ..., $t_N$. (For tree rings, this is easy as one ring = one year.)\\n\\nA time-series consists of an observation at each entry in the rank-order or measured-time list.  This measurement can also be qualitative or quantitative.  As an example of the former, we might have a record of the presence or absence of a certain fossil-type in each layer of the stratigraphic sequence. The latter type of time-series, composed of quantitative observations, might be the height of water in a lake, the lateral displacement of a GPS station, or, in the case of tree rings, maybe the mass-fraction of a pollutant in the wood.\\n\\n[Time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series) data can be equally spaced or not, but if not, then extra care must be taken to analyze them. Time-series refer to sequence of discrete in time data. This also means that the points have a relationship with one-another, i.e some points cannot exist before, or after other points. That organization, containted in the order, can be exploited to learn more about real-world processes. \\n\\nData where time (or rank order, or sequential order) doesn't matter are sometimes called `cross sectional data`. These are sets of data observed at a single time, or where time has no meaning. \\n\\nTypically, time series data have the following form: \\n1. a time or index variable, or (when unlucky), multiple columns that have to be combined to create a meaningful time variable (this is often the case, when year, month, day, time, etc. are in different columns)\\n2. other columns of data with measurements/values of interest.\\n\\nNote that datasets can of course also contain [both cross-sectional and time series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsroWpkUuYI) information, in which case analysis can be performed for each time step, and across time steps, yielding for very rich analysis. For example, we could have data that measure the temporal evolution of some environmental variables in various locations. One could therefore compare locations spatially, at each time point, look at the evolution of the data at each station, and also do both. That is, time series analysis may not necessarily only concern 1D datasets, but also 2D, 3D, or ND datasets. \\n\\nIn general, we will consider time-series composed of $N$ entries indexed by an integer $i$ that goes from 1 to $N$.  For each value of $i$ we will have a measure of the position (e.g.~time), $t_i$, and a measure of some quantity at that time, $q_i$.  Hence a general time-series can be represented as\\n$\\n  t_1,\\\\, t_2,\\\\, t_3,\\\\,...,\\\\,t_{N-1},\\\\,t_N; \\\\\\\\\\n  q_1,\\\\, q_2,\\\\, q_3,\\\\,...,\\\\,q_{N-1},\\\\,q_N.\\n$\\n\\nA primary consideration in analysing a time-series is whether its entries are `regularly spaced`.  Regular spacing means that there is a constant difference between $t_{i+1}$ and $t_i$:\\n\\n$\\n  t_{i+1} - t_i = \\\\Delta t\\\\text{, const. for all }i.\\n$\\n\\nThe spacing between successive measurements, $\\\\Delta t$, could be a microsecond, or a metre, or a million years; the important point is that the same spacing applies to any pair of consecutive entries in the series.\\n\\nIf $\\\\Delta t$ is not constant, then interpolation methods can be used to interpolate the original data onto a constant grid, with constant spacing. \\n\\nThere are many ways to interpolate data, but not one best way. It is up to the analyst to pick the 'best' way and this will depend on the data distribution, data type, and on the research objectives. It is hard to know a-priori what works best for a given case and the analyst will need to check that her/his choice will not critically affect the conclusion of the study. \\n\\n`Linear interpolation` is often an excellent first choice. It is simple and fast. However, because it relies on simply interpolating [between neighboring points using strait line segments](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter17.02-Linear-Interpolation.html), the interpolated product could be 'jagged'. Depending on the smoothness of the true process sampled by the time series, `higher-order polynomials` or `splines` could be used, or, as discuss later, a `loess/lowess` fit. \\n\\nPython provides many functions for **interpolation**, for instance from `scipy.interpolate`, such as [`interp1d`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.interp1d.html), [`interp2d`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.interp2d.html#scipy.interpolate.interp2d) for 2D grids for linear and bilinear interpolation, or [`UnivariateSpline`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline.html#scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline) or [`BivariateSpline`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.BivariateSpline.html#scipy.interpolate.BivariateSpline) for smoother options.

Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\\n\\nYou\\'ll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \\n\\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \\n\\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \\n\\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\\n\\n## This segment of the module\\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\\n\\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \\nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \\nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\\n\\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\\n\\n\\n## We will focus and use climate data.\\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \\n\\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \\n___', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 0}}]",

Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\\n\\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \\n\\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\\\left(1-exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-h}{ra}\\\\right)\\\\right)+n_{(0,\\\\infty)}\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\n    \\n2.

It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$. At this point, one can either compute the **spatial covariance**\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nC(k \\\\Delta h)=\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k\\\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nfrom which we can compute the **correlogram**, which is simply the spatial covariance normalized by the data variance (at $k=0$) so as to limit its range to $\\\\pm 1$,\\n\\n\\\\label{eq:corelogram}\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\rho(k \\\\Delta  h)=\\\\frac{C(k \\\\Delta h)}{C(0)}=\\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k \\\\Delta  h)d(x_i)}{\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^m(d(x_i)^2)}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nor look at the mean squared difference and form the **semivariogram**\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\gamma(k \\\\Delta  h)=\\\\frac{1}{2m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^m\\\\left(d(x_i+k\\\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\\\right)^2.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nThe functional forms $C(h)$, $\\\\rho(h)$ or $\\\\gamma(h)$ of these binned, discrete estimates is obtained simply by plotting $C(k\\\\Delta h)$, $\\\\rho(k\\\\Delta  h)$ or $\\\\gamma(k\\\\Delta  h)$ as a function of $k\\\\Delta h$ and by fitting a polynomial throught the results that ensures strictly positive values of $C(h)$, $\\\\rho(h)$ or $\\\\gamma(h)$ for any $h$.\\n\\nNote that the corelogram in geostatistics is very similar to the autocorrelation function used in time-series analysis. Indeed, as the lag-distance increases, both $\\\\rho(h)$ and $C(h)$ decrease, while $\\\\gamma(h)$ increases.\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 24}}, {'id': 1753902299806645, 'score': 0.64312255, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_2', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' problem under study, etc.\\nWhat does a model need?A very simple numerical exampledCdt=λCCi+1−Citi+1−ti=λCiCi+1=Ci1+λΔt()dCdt=limΔt→0C(t+Δt)−C(t)ΔtRequires discretization of derivativesand numerical integration to step forward from tito tf=NDTForward difference(aka Forward Euler)[climatemodelsusemuchmorecomplex schemes]\\nii+1\\nWhat does a model need?Discretization needed to implement numericallydCdt=λCCi+1−CiΔt=λCi+1Ci+1=λΔtCi+1+CiCi+1=Ci11−λΔtBackward difference(aka backward Euler)Requires solving', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 2}}, {'id': 1753903968170312, 'score': 0.6429632, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_42_code', 'type': 'code', 'content': '#slice dataset - include data from the Indian Ocean only (you can play with this as you wish)\\n\\nuaviso = uaviso.sel(longitude = slice(16, 120))\\nuaviso = uaviso.sel(latitude = slice(-75, 0))\\nuaviso\\n\\nvaviso = vaviso.sel(longitude = slice(16, 120))\\nvaviso = vaviso.sel(latitude = slice(-75, 0))\\nvaviso', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 42}}, {'id': 1753903424703434, 'score': 0.6419743, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_26_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"- **Attributes**: The last category of information required are 'attributes'.

Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\\n\\nYou\\'ll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \\n\\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \\n\\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \\n\\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\\n\\n## This segment of the module\\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\\n\\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \\nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \\nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\\n\\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\\n\\n\\n## We will focus and use climate data.\\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \\n\\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \\n___', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 0}}, {'id': 1753902702944729, 'score': 0.6255195, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_9', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'task.

Here's a structured summary of the core ideas:\n\n\n- **MA(q) Models (Moving Average):**  \n  - Use **past errors** (εₜ₋₁, εₜ₋₂, ..., εₜ₋q) to predict future values.  \n  - The \"order\" (q) indicates the number of lagged errors considered.  \n  - MA models are **short-memory** (e.g., MA(1) = Xₜ = μ + εₜ + θ₁εₜ₋₁).  \n  - They are part of the **ARIMA** family (ARIMA(p,d,q) combines AR, MA, and differencing).\n\n- **ARIMA Models:**  \n  - Combine **autoregressive (AR)**, **moving average (MA)**, and **differencing** to handle non-stationary time series.  \n  - AR(p) captures dependencies on past values (Xₜ = μ + θ₁Xₜ₋₁ + ... + θₚXₜ₋ₚ).  \n  - MA(q) captures dependencies on past errors (Xₜ = μ + εₜ + θ₁εₜ₋₁ + ... + θₖεₜ₋ₖ).  \n  - ARIMA(p,d,q) is used for modeling time series with trends and seasonality.\n\n- **Error Terms (εₜ):**  \n  - Assumed to be **white noise** (independent, uncorrelated, and normally distributed).  \n  - Model performance is evaluated using **residuals** (εₜ) to check for autocorrelation and stationarity.\n\n\n- **Kriging (Objective Mapping):**  \n  - A geostatistical method for interpolating spatial data.  \n  - Uses **covariance matrices** to estimate values at unobserved locations.  \n  - Accounts for spatial correlation (e.g., neighboring points influence each other).  \n  - **Gauss-Markov process** assumes that errors are uncorrelated and have constant variance.\n\n- **Spatial Autocorrelation:**  \n  - Measures the degree to which a variable is correlated with itself in space.  \n  - Used to assess model fit and detect spatial patterns (e.g., spatial lag models).\n\n\n- **Model Performance Metrics:**  \n  - **Error relative to the mean** (e.g., RMSE, MAE) to assess accuracy.  \n  - **Error relative to the multi-model mean** (e.g., how well a model performs compared to others).  \n  - **Probabilistic Acceptance:**  \n    - Models may not perfectly capture reality (e.g., spatial patterns with offsets).  \n    - Probabilistic predictions (e.g., confidence intervals) are often used when deterministic models fail.\n\n\n- **Short Memory Models (MA):**  \n  - MA models are \"short memory\" because their influence decays over time",

Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\\n\\nYou\\'ll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \\n\\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \\n\\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \\n\\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\\n\\n## This segment of the module\\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\\n\\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \\nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \\nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\\n\\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\\n\\n\\n## We will focus and use climate data.\\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \\n\\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \\n___', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 0}}]",

    "response": "The provided contexts focus on **climate data analysis**, emphasizing **time series and spatial analysis techniques** using tools like **statsmodels** and the **CDS API**. Here's a structured summary of the key concepts:\n\n\n- **Tools**:  \n  - **`statsmodels`** (Python library) for time series decomposition.  \n  - **Seasonal Decomposition** (e.g., `seasonal_decompose`) to separate trends, seasonality, and residuals.  \n  - **Additive/Multiplicative Models**:  \n    - **Additive**: $ Y[t] = T[t] + S[t] + e[t] $ (flat trend + seasonality + noise).  \n    - **Multiplicative**: $ Y[t] = T[t] \\times S[t] \\times e[t] $ (non-linear interactions).  \n- **Applications**:  \n  - Removing seasonal patterns (e.g., using moving averages).  \n  - Detecting long-term trends (e.g., random walk data with added periodicity).  \n  - Example: Detrending ERA5 temperature data using `statsmodels`.\n\n\n- **Method**: **Kriging** (Gauss-Markov regression).  \n  - **Goal**: Predict spatial values (e.g., temperature) based on nearby observations.  \n  - **Principles**:  \n    - Assumes spatial correlation (e.g., neighboring points are influenced by each other).  \n    - Uses a covariance matrix to quantify influence.  \n  - **Use Case**: Spatial interpolation (e.g., creating maps from grid data).  \n\n\n- **Tool**: **CDS API** (Climate Data Store API).  \n  - **Example**:  \n    ```python\n    import cdsapi\n    c = cdsapi.Client(full_stack=True)\n    r = c.retrieve(\"reanalysis-era5-single-levels\", {\n        \"variable\": \"2t\",\n        \"product_type\": \"reanalysis\",\n        \"date\": \"2021-01-01\",\n        \"time\": \"14:00\"\n    })\n    r.download(\"output/ERA5_testmap.png\")\n    ```  \n  - **Purpose**: Access historical climate data (e.g., ERA5 reanalysis) for analysis.\n\n\n- **Data Preprocessing**:  \n  - Detrending and seasonal decomposition are critical for isolating trends and periodic patterns.  \n  - Spatial analysis (e.g., kriging) helps interpolate missing data.  \n- **Tools**:  \n  - **`statsmodels`** (time series) and **CDS API** (spatial data) are central to climate analysis.  \n- **Importance**:  \n  - Understanding underlying models (e.g., Gauss-Markov processes) ensures accurate interpretation of climate data.  \n\nThis framework enables researchers to analyze climate data effectively, whether focusing on temporal trends, spatial patterns, or data retrieval.",

It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902702794239, 'score': 0.6596098, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_8', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'cool and warm the climateThe microphysics responsible for cloud formation is not well understoodThe grid cells in models are much much bigger than time/space scales relevant for cloud physicsÞMagnitude/location of rain events is hard to predict wellÞThat information is useful though!\\nComparing models with data•What is a data point?

One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902702794239, 'score': 0.6237086, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_8', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'cool and warm the climateThe microphysics responsible for cloud formation is not well understoodThe grid cells in models are much much bigger than time/space scales relevant for cloud physicsÞMagnitude/location of rain events is hard to predict wellÞThat information is useful though!\\nComparing models with data•What is a data point?

NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\\n\\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \\n\\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\\n\\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\\n\\n\\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)).

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753907767547004, 'score': 0.61430895, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_timeseriesanalysis-IC-X9CYXD36RX.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='timeseries'></a>\\n## Data with a time dimension\\n\\nEnvironmental scientists frequently need to analyse measurements that form a `sequence` - an ordered series. This series may be ordered in space (e.g. down a stratigraphic section) or in time (e.g. over the past 100 years). In either case, these are known as `time series`, and the term `time-series analysis` is used to describe the application of quantitative methods to discover patterns in the data. \\n\\nThe series variable can be defined either by a rank-order or by a quantitative measure of position along the series axis (time or space). To illustrate this, consider a tree rings.  A rank-order series is defined by the order that the rings appear, from inside to outside: first, second, third, ..., last.  A quantitative sequence measure, on the other hand, can be defined if each ring is dated, with ages: $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$, ..., $t_N$.

The latter type of time-series, composed of quantitative observations, might be the height of water in a lake, the lateral displacement of a GPS station, or, in the case of tree rings, maybe the mass-fraction of a pollutant in the wood.\\n\\n[Time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series) data can be equally spaced or not, but if not, then extra care must be taken to analyze them. Time-series refer to sequence of discrete in time data. This also means that the points have a relationship with one-another, i.e some points cannot exist before, or after other points. That organization, containted in the order, can be exploited to learn more about real-world processes. \\n\\nData where time (or rank order, or sequential order) doesn't matter are sometimes called `cross sectional data`. These are sets of data observed at a single time, or where time has no meaning. \\n\\nTypically, time series data have the following form: \\n1. a time or index variable, or (when unlucky), multiple columns that have to be combined to create a meaningful time variable (this is often the case, when year, month, day, time, etc. are in different columns)\\n2. other columns of data with measurements/values of interest.\\n\\nNote that datasets can of course also contain [both cross-sectional and time series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsroWpkUuYI) information, in which case analysis can be performed for each time step, and across time steps, yielding for very rich analysis. For example, we could have data that measure the temporal evolution of some environmental variables in various locations. One could therefore compare locations spatially, at each time point, look at the evolution of the data at each station, and also do both. That is, time series analysis may not necessarily only concern 1D datasets, but also 2D, 3D, or ND datasets. \\n\\nIn general, we will consider time-series composed of $N$ entries indexed by an integer $i$ that goes from 1 to $N$.  For each value of $i$ we will have a measure of the position (e.g.~time), $t_i$, and a measure of some quantity at that time, $q_i$.

The semivariogram, often defined as $\\\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \\n\\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\\n1.

It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data.

NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\\n\\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \\n\\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\\n\\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\\n\\n\\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)).

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424509295, 'score': 0.6131648, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 01- Introduction to climate data and climate models\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n## Contents\\n- [Lectures](#lectures)\\n- [Question](#question)\\n- [ESMValTool](#ESMValTool)\\n- [Sources of climate data](#climatedata)\\n- [CEDA](#CEDA)\\n- [File formats](#fileformat)\\n- [Metadata](#metadata)\\n- [NetCDF](#NetCDF)\\n- [NCO](#NCO)\\n- [Reanalysis products](#reanalysis)\\n- [Climate services UKCP18](#ukcp18)\\n  \\n## Learning outcomes\\n1.

The Toolbox is a programming interface. It is free and available to everyone. It links raw data to an online computing facility, thereby removing the computing barrier for users worldwide. The Toolbox allows users to develop python scripts for the CDS and to run them online. The users than then simply download the maps, graph or secondary data without needing to incur the costs associated with storing and maintaining the large climate data archive locally, nor is it required to invest in a powerful computer. \\n\\n\\nThe Toolbox works hand-in-hand with the CDS API. \\n\\nThat is, one can issue commmands to the Toolbox via the CDS API, or develop a python script that does certain things, and then use the CDS API functionality to send it to CDS for evaluation, only to download the finished product locally. \\n\\nExamples of how to proceed are given [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/COPSRV/Call+a+service+with+the+CDS+API). \\n\\nNote, it is also possible to use the CDS Toolbox to plot data from other services (i.e. not originally stored on CDS), using the `remote` function instead of the `service` function. This is possible thanks to protocols such as OPeNDAP. Here is an example using data from UNIDATA. \\n\\nFor illustration of how the Toolbox can be used, the following piece of code, run locally, after the CDS API is properly configured and assuming one is connected to the internet, will produce, and then download to our `output/` directory, a map of global temperature on January 1st 2021 at 14:00.', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 43}}, {'id': 1753903424142956, 'score': 0.6110362, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_4_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='ESMValTool'></a>\\n\\n# Python environments to consider for working with climate data \\n\\n* ## Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool)\\n![esmvaltool](img/ESMValTool-logo-2.png)\\n\\nThis week, it should be possible to simply install packages as needed...\\n\\nHowever, if you anticipate possible future needs, you may want to invest a bit of effort to setup a specific python environment to work with climate data. If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

The users than then simply download the maps, graph or secondary data without needing to incur the costs associated with storing and maintaining the large climate data archive locally, nor is it required to invest in a powerful computer. \\n\\n\\nThe Toolbox works hand-in-hand with the CDS API. \\n\\nThat is, one can issue commmands to the Toolbox via the CDS API, or develop a python script that does certain things, and then use the CDS API functionality to send it to CDS for evaluation, only to download the finished product locally. \\n\\nExamples of how to proceed are given [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/COPSRV/Call+a+service+with+the+CDS+API). \\n\\nNote, it is also possible to use the CDS Toolbox to plot data from other services (i.e. not originally stored on CDS), using the `remote` function instead of the `service` function. This is possible thanks to protocols such as OPeNDAP. Here is an example using data from UNIDATA. \\n\\nFor illustration of how the Toolbox can be used, the following piece of code, run locally, after the CDS API is properly configured and assuming one is connected to the internet, will produce, and then download to our `output/` directory, a map of global temperature on January 1st 2021 at 14:00.', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 43}}, {'id': 1753903968084902, 'score': 0.64911556, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='spatial'></a>\\n# Analysis of spatial data\\n\\nSo far in this class, we have mostly considered the analysis of data-series from single locations, where some property is measured repeadedly in time, or data that came already gridded in easy to use format. \\n\\nHowever, often in environmental sciences, we are faced with a different or additional problem; that is one will have to either make sense of many single measurements dispersed in space or even with multiple time-series dispersed in space. \\n\\nThe problem of making sense of spatially dispersed data is often linked to the problem of `contouring`. Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903424623019, 'score': 0.6473756, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_37_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"### Climate Data Operators (CDO)\\nThe Climate Data Operators ([CDO](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo)) software is a collection of >600 operators for standard processing of climate and forecast model data.

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424509295, 'score': 0.6525394, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 01- Introduction to climate data and climate models\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n## Contents\\n- [Lectures](#lectures)\\n- [Question](#question)\\n- [ESMValTool](#ESMValTool)\\n- [Sources of climate data](#climatedata)\\n- [CEDA](#CEDA)\\n- [File formats](#fileformat)\\n- [Metadata](#metadata)\\n- [NetCDF](#NetCDF)\\n- [NCO](#NCO)\\n- [Reanalysis products](#reanalysis)\\n- [Climate services UKCP18](#ukcp18)\\n  \\n## Learning outcomes\\n1.

A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753903424262111, 'score': 0.69922304, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_38_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='reanalysis'></a>\\n\\n# Reanalysis products\\n\\n![C3S](img/c3s-logo.png)\\n![ECMWF](img/logo-ecmwf.png) \\n\\n[*ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables. The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424228032, 'score': 0.6971314, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_43_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '### The CDS Toolbox\\n\\nAn extention to the CDS API is the [CDS Toolbox](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/toolbox/doc/index.html).

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753901956747387, 'score': 0.6794883, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_1', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.4.

This series may be ordered in space (e.g. down a stratigraphic section) or in time (e.g. over the past 100 years). In either case, these are known as `time series`, and the term `time-series analysis` is used to describe the application of quantitative methods to discover patterns in the data. \\n\\nThe series variable can be defined either by a rank-order or by a quantitative measure of position along the series axis (time or space). To illustrate this, consider a tree rings.  A rank-order series is defined by the order that the rings appear, from inside to outside: first, second, third, ..., last.  A quantitative sequence measure, on the other hand, can be defined if each ring is dated, with ages: $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$, ..., $t_N$. (For tree rings, this is easy as one ring = one year.)\\n\\nA time-series consists of an observation at each entry in the rank-order or measured-time list.

This series may be ordered in space (e.g. down a stratigraphic section) or in time (e.g. over the past 100 years). In either case, these are known as `time series`, and the term `time-series analysis` is used to describe the application of quantitative methods to discover patterns in the data. \\n\\nThe series variable can be defined either by a rank-order or by a quantitative measure of position along the series axis (time or space). To illustrate this, consider a tree rings.  A rank-order series is defined by the order that the rings appear, from inside to outside: first, second, third, ..., last.  A quantitative sequence measure, on the other hand, can be defined if each ring is dated, with ages: $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$, ..., $t_N$. (For tree rings, this is easy as one ring = one year.)\\n\\nA time-series consists of an observation at each entry in the rank-order or measured-time list.

It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data.

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`.

Metadata are not the data themselves, but are required to provide context and therefore inform the data analysis.** \\n\\nThere are two types of metadata, \"**discover metadata**\", which can be used to locate the dataset in a search, and \"**detailed metadata**\", which contain the information necessary to use the data (ideally) without having to ask the data provider for more information (even if one of the key piece of information should be the data provider information and contact detail!).\\n\\nThere is no upper limit as to what information should be included in the metadata, but typical metadata comprise information about when and where the observations, or the file, where produced, how they were produced (which instrument, technique, algorithm were used), information about the experiment the data come from, maybe some information about data accuracy (if not provided as seperate data in the file), information about who produced the data or the file, including contact information, or appropriate reference(s), and, if relevant, additional information about the research context, i.e. which project is associated with these data (this could help the user understand if more data from this group/project exist or can be expected). If the data represent a subset of a larger dataset, this should also be mentioned. \\n\\nAnother key pieces of information that the metadata should provide are a description of the variables in the file, with variable **names**, and the **units** of these variables. \\n\\nIf the data in the file represent a processed version of other raw data, then one should add information about these raw data as well, their provenance, references, and the transformation that was made, etc. One should be able to track the chain of information all the way to the orginal observations (or model output). \\n\\nIf the data represent gridded variables, then the nature of the grid on which these data are defined should also be explained. \\n\\nSimilarly, if the position, or some other features of the data, depend on a reference system, that reference system should be given. This will be discussed in more depth during the introduction to geostatistics lecture. \\n\\nIn the case of climate models (or other models, if relevant), the metadata should also include information about the model itself, the model name, version, the length of the integration, maybe a brief description of the spin-up, boundary conditions, initial conditions used to produce the simulation. \\n\\nObviously the information that will be included in the metadata vary substantially. You should learn (and will discover - mostly through shear frustration when key information is missing!) what constitute useful metadata in your field of work. \\n\\nMetadata can be included in the file itself (if the file format allows it), as separate files, or in the form of some other documents. When sourcing data, always make a note of where the data come from. This is especially true if getting data online as it is very easy to download data and then forget where they come from. Detailed note-taking is part of the job of the data analyst (and that of any scientist!). \\n\\nWhen metadata is included in the file directly, this typically comes as a header, or in a specified location in the file. The netCDF format has rules for how/where to include metadata, which is one of the reason why netCDF data are particularly useful and popular in climate science. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 9}}, {'id': 1753902703226725, 'score': 0.61236626, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_13', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' model do it all?Processes operate on various time/space scales\\nHigher resolution•(more data)•(local extremes)•(shorter simulation)•(no/few ensembles)Lower resolution•(fewer data)•(longer simulation)•(many ensembles)\\n\\nTake home messages•Models will always be imperfect (accept this!)–the challenge is to make them useful by keeping them as simple as possible in spite oftheir limitations •very difficult in practice, requires deep scientific knowledge•Understanding of the question and of the tools a', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf', 'chunk_number': 13}}, {'id': 1753903968186832, 'score': 0.60852444, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_32_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"# GDAL: Geospatial Data Abstraction Library\\n\\n[GDAL](https://gdal.org/index.html)is a C++ translator library for over 200 raster and vector geospatial data formats.

[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753902703457059, 'score': 0.64742136, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_6', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'in R.

If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\\n\\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \\n\\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement. The contoured estimate will tend to either over or underestimate the true value, within a tolerance controlled by the noise associated with the measurements. \\n\\nThe shape of the fitted surface will depend strongly on the data available: their locations, their uncertainties, as well as subjective choices made during the analysis (i.e. definition of the so-called 'covariance matrix').\\n\\nWe will here look at a technique called **kriging**, pioneered by a South African mining engineer called Danie G.

Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\\n\\nYou\\'ll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \\n\\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \\n\\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \\n\\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\\n\\n## This segment of the module\\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\\n\\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \\nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \\nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\\n\\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\\n\\n\\n## We will focus and use climate data.\\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \\n\\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \\n___', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 0}}, {'id': 1753902703272079, 'score': 0.63084435, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_14', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'vailable–The skill of the analyst is to know how far to push the interpretation and to select the correct model/simulations for the right question (exploit experimental design)•Main sources of uncertainties to consider•Numericsand choice of equations/implementation•Resolution•Parameterizations•Boundary conditions and forcing•Internal dynamics•Influence of uncertainties on final conclusions of analysis must be considered\\n\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf', 'chunk_number': 14}}]",

    "response": "The provided content revolves around **climate models**, their **limitations**, and the **role of data assimilation** and **observations** in improving their accuracy and utility. Here's a structured summary of the key themes:\n\n\n- **Incomplete Representation**: Models cannot fully capture all physical processes (e.g., cloud microphysics, ocean-atmosphere coupling). For instance, the effect of \"Z\" (e.g., solar radiation) on climate is harder to model than \"W\" (e.g., greenhouse gases), highlighting the **inherent incompleteness** of models.\n- **Parameter Sensitivity**: Models rely on **free parameters** that are often tuned to fit data, but this can lead to **inaccurate predictions** if the tuning is flawed.\n- **Uncertainty**: Models are **\"wrong\"** and **\"incomplete\"**, as they simplify complex systems. Even \"best\" models may not replicate real-world data due to unresolved physics or data limitations.\n\n\n- **Data Assimilation**: Techniques like **4DVAR** (four-dimensional variational analysis) are used to \"fit\" models to observational data. While this improves model accuracy, it also raises questions about **model validity** (e.g., \"fitting a bad model for a wrong reason\").\n- **Observational Data**: Models rely on **real-world data** to validate their outputs. However, data availability is limited, and models cannot predict future scenarios without continuous data input.\n- **Usefulness of Models**: Despite imperfections, models are **extremely useful** for understanding past and present climate patterns. They help identify trends, validate hypotheses, and guide policy decisions.\n\n\n- **Trade-offs**: Models simplify physics and scales (e.g., grid resolution vs. time/space scales), leading to **\"filtering\"** of complex processes. This trade-off is critical for computational feasibility but may reduce predictive accuracy.\n- **Model Interpretation**: Even imperfect models provide **insights** into climate variability and feedback mechanisms. Their **\"rightness\"** is debated, but their **internal consistency** and **reliability** are key to their utility.\n\n\n- **Coupled Models**: Ocean-atmosphere interactions are central to climate models. The \"coupler\" (e.g., coupling mechanisms) is vital for simulating Earth's climate.\n- **Model Validation**: Comparing model outputs with observations (e.g., temperature, precipitation) is essential. However, this is constrained by data availability and model resolution.\n\n\nClimate models are **complex, imperfect tools** that balance **accuracy** with **computational feasibility**. While they cannot fully replicate real-world systems, they remain critical for **research, policy, and forecasting**. The focus is on **improving model reliability** through better data assimilation, parameter tuning, and understanding of unresolved physics, even as models",
    "reference": "Each scheme handles numerical integration differently, affecting model stability and accuracy. Forward Euler is simple but less stable, backward Euler is more stable but computationally demanding, and centered difference is more accurate but requires more data points. These differences lead to varied results even for the same equations."

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902702662417, 'score': 0.67668223, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_10', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ls that are ‘fitted’ to data•Some model parameters are tuned to fit–Question is what to fit/how?

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \\n\\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe (\\'18\\' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \\n\\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that\\'s a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \\n\\nAlthough UKCP18 is \\'just\\' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\\n\\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\\n\\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn\\'t contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \\n\\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\\n\\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \\n\\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\\n\\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \\nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \\n\\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \\n\\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \\n\\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \\n\\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\\n3. Output: Data only\\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\\n   \\nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \\n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \\n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \\n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \\n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can\\'t differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \\n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that\\'s a lot of data!).\\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \\n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \\n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \\n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don\\'t close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \\n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \\n\\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\\n\\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \\n\\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we\\'ll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\\n\\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 46}}]",

    "response": "The relationship between **climate models** and **data** is foundational to their functionality and validation. Here's a structured breakdown:\n\n1. **Data as a Requirement**:\n   - **Climate models** require **boundary conditions**, **initial conditions**, and **equations** (mathematical statements describing system relationships) to operate. These are **data** (e.g., measurements, parameterizations, and physical laws).\n   - **Numerical models** (a subset of climate models) rely on **data** to simulate real-world systems (e.g., atmospheric processes, ocean dynamics, land-ice interactions).\n\n2. **Data Usage**:\n   - **Data** is **used to test** models (e.g., validating predictions against real-world observations).\n   - **Data** is **added to files** (e.g., datasets) to support model simulations and analyses.\n\n3. **Data-Driven Predictions**:\n   - **Climate models** are used to **predict climate extremes** (e.g., extreme weather events, sea-level rise) by leveraging **data** (e.g., historical climate records, satellite observations, and physical parameters).\n\n4. **Data in Models**:\n   - **Data** is **required** for model calibration and validation, ensuring accuracy (e.g., boundary conditions derived from observational data).\n   - **Data** is **used to generate ensembles** (multiple simulations) to assess uncertainty.\n\n**Climate models** depend on **data** (e.g., boundary conditions, equations, measurements) to simulate and predict climate systems. **Data** is both a prerequisite for model operation and a product of model validation. Without accurate and comprehensive data, climate models cannot reliably forecast extreme events or quantify climate systems.",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753903424262111, 'score': 0.6712624, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_38_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='reanalysis'></a>\\n\\n# Reanalysis products\\n\\n![C3S](img/c3s-logo.png)\\n![ECMWF](img/logo-ecmwf.png) \\n\\n[*ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables. The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753901956989969, 'score': 0.67054677, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_2', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g.calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).Learning objectives of the Environmental Data module•Growing/important field –with likely career opportunities•Great playground to deliver learning objectives\\nUsing climate models: quantification/forecasting(impacts, adaptation, mitigation)\\nhttps://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts\\nUsing climate models: designscenarios(explore policy,', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf', 'chunk_number': 2}}]",

    "response": "To address the complexities of model evaluation, uncertainty characterization, and data analysis in climate and spatial contexts, the following key principles and strategies are essential:\n\n\n- **Model Performance Metrics**:\n  - **Error Relative to Multi-Model Mean**: Compare models' outputs to an averaged reference (e.g., ensemble averages) to assess their accuracy. This helps identify systematic biases or gaps in individual models.\n  - **Internal Variability vs. Forcing**: Natural variability (e.g., climate cycles) vs. external forcings (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions) must be distinguished. Models may excel in capturing one but falter in the other.\n  - **Ensemble Simulations**: Use multiple simulations (e.g., with different initial conditions or parameterizations) to quantify uncertainty. This is critical for climate projections, as models may \"agree\" on some aspects but diverge on others.\n\n- **Sources of Uncertainty**:\n  - **Data Limitations**: Sparse sampling, measurement errors, or incomplete datasets can bias results.\n  - **Model Assumptions**: Simplified physics, parameterizations, or boundary conditions may introduce errors.\n  - **Computational Resolution**: Higher resolution models may capture finer details but require more resources and may not be feasible for all analyses.\n\n\n- **Interpolation Techniques**:\n  - **Kriging**: A geostatistical method that optimally interpolates data by minimizing spatial correlation errors. It accounts for uncertainties in measurements and is particularly useful when data is sparse or noisy.\n  - **Optimal Interpolation**: When data is not well-sampled, avoid forcing a surface to pass through every control point. Instead, fit a surface to the available data, balancing accuracy and smoothness.\n\n- **Handling Uncertainties**:\n  - **Covariance Matrices**: Subjective choices in defining covariance (e.g., spatial correlation) influence interpolated results. Careful calibration is needed to reflect real-world variability.\n  - **Error Propagation**: Model the uncertainty in input data and propagate it through the analysis to quantify the reliability of outputs.\n\n\n- **Model Simplification**:\n  - **Simplify Where Possible**: Use \"if-then\" logic (e.g., \"if data is sparse, use kriging\") to balance computational cost and accuracy.\n  - **Avoid Overfitting**: Ensure models are not overly complex (e.g., too many parameters) that may not generalize to new data.\n\n- **Data-Driven Decisions**:\n  - **Prioritize Relevant Variables**: Focus on variables most critical to the analysis (e.g., temperature, precipitation) rather than all possible metrics.\n  - **Validate Against Ground Truth**: Use independent datasets or observational data to test model outputs, even if they are not perfectly sampled.\n\n\n- **Model Interpretation**:\n  - **Probabilistic Outputs**: Accept that models may provide probabilistic forecasts (e.g.,",

Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\\n\\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \\n\\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\\\left(1-exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-h}{ra}\\\\right)\\\\right)+n_{(0,\\\\infty)}\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\n    \\n2.

It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$.

The answer will depend on any additional constraints that one applies on these weights and on any additional properties one wishes the field $F$ or $D$ to have (stationarity of various moments, isotropy, etc.). Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}, {'id': 1753902702662417, 'score': 0.62424684, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_10', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ls that are ‘fitted’ to data•Some model parameters are tuned to fit–Question is what to fit/how?

Here's a structured summary of the main points:\n\n\n- **Core Requirements**: \n  - Models need **equations** (e.g., governing physical laws) and **initial/boundary conditions**.\n  - They must preserve **fundamental conservation properties** (mass, momentum, energy).\n- **Numerical Diffusion**: \n  - Every numerical scheme has inherent **weaknesses and strengths**. \n  - **Numerical diffusion** can distort results, especially in simulations without exact solutions.\n  - **Testing** models requires comparing outputs to known solutions or historical data.\n\n\n- **Grid Resolution**:\n  - Climate models use **grid boxes** (e.g., latitude/longitude grids) to represent spatial and temporal variability.\n  - **Smaller grids** improve resolution but increase computational cost.\n  - **Topography and bathymetry** are critical for accurate simulations (e.g., mountains, ocean depths).\n- **Subgrid Processes**:\n  - Processes like **eddies**, **overflows**, or **cloud microphysics** are **parameterized** (simplified) to account for scale differences.\n\n\n- **Parameter Tuning**:\n  - Model parameters (e.g., cloud formation rates, ocean heat uptake) are often **tuned to fit data** (e.g., data assimilation).\n  - **Data assimilation** (e.g., 4DVAR) helps improve model accuracy by incorporating real-world observations.\n- **Model Limitations**:\n  - Models are **incomplete** and **inaccurate** due to simplifications. Errors can arise from:\n    - **Parameterization errors** (e.g., incorrect assumptions about cloud dynamics).\n    - **Numerical errors** (e.g., instability in simulations).\n    - **Missing processes** (e.g., soil moisture, land-ice feedbacks).\n\n\n- **Using Data**:\n  - Models are **fitted to data** (e.g., historical observations) to improve predictions.\n  - **Optimal interpolation** (e.g., **kriging**) is used to estimate spatial fields from sparse data.\n  - **Surface fitting** minimizes misfit errors by fitting a surface to scattered data, rather than forcing it to pass through every point.\n- **Validation**:\n  - Models are validated by comparing outputs to **historical data** or **ground truth**.\n  - **Skill** in modelers depends on balancing **model complexity** with **data utility** (e.g., understanding how to interpret model outputs).\n\n\n- **Model Errors**:\n  - Models can",

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}]",

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903968837366, 'score': 0.6254866, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_24_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"#### Variograms, correlograms and semi-variograms\\n\\nKrigging requires estimation of a so-called covariance matrix, which describes the relationship between observations. Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\\n\\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \\n\\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\\n1.

It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$.

    "response": "The provided contexts discuss critical challenges and considerations in climate modeling, data analysis, and uncertainty management. Here's a structured summary of key points:\n\n- **Model Imperfection**: Models are inherently imperfect due to simplifications, incomplete physics, and computational limitations. They cannot fully replicate real-world complexity (e.g., cloud microphysics, precipitation patterns).\n- **Uncertainties**: Sources of uncertainty include:\n  - **Numerical errors** (e.g., grid resolution, equations).\n  - **Parameterizations** (simplified representations of processes like convection or radiation).\n  - **Boundary conditions** (e.g., initial states, forcing).\n  - **Internal dynamics** (e.g., chaotic behavior in climate systems).\n- **Model vs. Data**: Models may reproduce mean states well but struggle with variability (e.g., extreme weather events). They often require validation against observational data.\n\n- **Data vs. Models**: \n  - Models are \"just\" simulations, while observations (e.g., satellite data, ground measurements) provide real-world validation.\n  - Observations help constrain models and assess their accuracy.\n- **Data Assimilation**: Techniques like 4DVAR (data assimilation) integrate observations into models to improve their predictive skill.\n\n- **Experimental Design**: \n  - Careful planning is essential to isolate variables (e.g., forcing, resolution) and reduce confounding factors.\n  - Ensembles (multiple simulations with slight variations) help quantify uncertainty.\n- **Uncertainty Characterization**: \n  - Analysts must account for:\n    - **Measurement errors** (e.g., instrument limitations).\n    - **Environmental uncertainties** (e.g., natural variability, feedbacks).\n    - **Model uncertainties** (e.g., parameter choices, grid resolution).\n\n- **Interpretation Limits**: Models cannot fully capture all physical processes, so interpretations must balance simplicity with accuracy.\n- **Model Selection**: Choosing the right model for a specific question (e.g., predicting future climate vs. assessing historical trends) is critical.\n- **Trade-offs**: Higher resolution models require more data and computational power, but they improve accuracy in local extremes and short-term simulations.\n\n- **Models are imperfect** but can be useful when designed with proper experimental controls and validated against observations.\n- **Data assimilation** (e.g., using real-time observations) enhances model accuracy.\n- **Uncertainty analysis** is vital to interpret model outputs reliably, especially in policy and",

On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}]",

    "response": "The provided contexts collectively focus on **climate modeling challenges**, **uncertainties**, **experimental design**, **resolution effects**, and **statistical analysis** in time series. Here's a synthesis of the key points:\n\n\n- **Uncertainties**:  \n  - Model limitations (e.g., parameterizations, boundary conditions, numerical errors).  \n  - Sources of uncertainty (e.g., measurement errors, environmental variability, and experimental design).  \n  - Sensitivity to inputs (e.g., initial conditions, forcing, and resolution).  \n\n- **Resolution Effects**:  \n  - Higher resolution increases computational cost (e.g., 8x more calculations for 3x spatial resolution).  \n  - Trade-offs between accuracy and computational feasibility (e.g., balancing spatial/temporal resolution with model complexity).  \n\n- **Experimental Design**:  \n  - Importance of controlled experiments (e.g., control vs. experimental setups) to isolate variables.  \n  - Need for robust statistical methods to characterize uncertainties (e.g., ensemble simulations, sensitivity analysis).  \n\n\n- **Numerical Diffusion**:  \n  - Models may introduce errors due to discretization (e.g., time steps, spatial grids).  \n  - Challenges in maintaining stability and accuracy (e.g., reducing time steps for higher resolution).  \n\n- **Model Simulations**:  \n  - Trade-offs between **resolution** (higher resolution = better accuracy but higher cost) and **ensemble size** (more ensembles = better uncertainty characterization but higher computational demand).  \n\n\n- **Time Series Analysis**:  \n  - Tests like the Zivot–Andrews test highlight the importance of **signal-to-noise ratios** in detecting non-stationarity.  \n  - Weak-stationarity vs. non-stationarity can be ambiguous, especially when signals are weak relative to noise.  \n\n- **Data Analysis**:  \n  - Design strategies must account for data types, distribution constraints, and limitations.  \n  - Balancing statistical tools (e.g., parametric tests) with environmental dynamics and measurement errors.  \n\n\n- **Models are imperfect**: Accept limitations but strive for simplicity and usefulness.  \n- **Experimental design is critical**: Careful planning ensures valid results and minimizes biases.  \n- **Resolution vs. cost**: Higher resolution demands significant computational resources.  \n- **Statistical rigor**: Use robust methods to characterize uncertainties and interpret results.  \n\n\nIf you’re referring to specific experiments (e.g., climate simulations, ensemble experiments, or time series analyses), the above points would apply to their requirements. For example:  \n- **Climate simulations** require balancing resolution and computational cost.  \n- **Ensemble experiments** emphasize sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification.  \n- **Time series tests** highlight the need for signal-to-noise analysis in detecting trends or anomalies.  \n\nLet me know if you’d like a focused breakdown of any particular experiment or application!",

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902702662417, 'score': 0.69337684, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_10', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ls that are ‘fitted’ to data•Some model parameters are tuned to fit–Question is what to fit/how?

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!).

Metadata are not the data themselves, but are required to provide context and therefore inform the data analysis.** \\n\\nThere are two types of metadata, \"**discover metadata**\", which can be used to locate the dataset in a search, and \"**detailed metadata**\", which contain the information necessary to use the data (ideally) without having to ask the data provider for more information (even if one of the key piece of information should be the data provider information and contact detail!).\\n\\nThere is no upper limit as to what information should be included in the metadata, but typical metadata comprise information about when and where the observations, or the file, where produced, how they were produced (which instrument, technique, algorithm were used), information about the experiment the data come from, maybe some information about data accuracy (if not provided as seperate data in the file), information about who produced the data or the file, including contact information, or appropriate reference(s), and, if relevant, additional information about the research context, i.e. which project is associated with these data (this could help the user understand if more data from this group/project exist or can be expected). If the data represent a subset of a larger dataset, this should also be mentioned. \\n\\nAnother key pieces of information that the metadata should provide are a description of the variables in the file, with variable **names**, and the **units** of these variables. \\n\\nIf the data in the file represent a processed version of other raw data, then one should add information about these raw data as well, their provenance, references, and the transformation that was made, etc. One should be able to track the chain of information all the way to the orginal observations (or model output). \\n\\nIf the data represent gridded variables, then the nature of the grid on which these data are defined should also be explained. \\n\\nSimilarly, if the position, or some other features of the data, depend on a reference system, that reference system should be given. This will be discussed in more depth during the introduction to geostatistics lecture. \\n\\nIn the case of climate models (or other models, if relevant), the metadata should also include information about the model itself, the model name, version, the length of the integration, maybe a brief description of the spin-up, boundary conditions, initial conditions used to produce the simulation. \\n\\nObviously the information that will be included in the metadata vary substantially. You should learn (and will discover - mostly through shear frustration when key information is missing!) what constitute useful metadata in your field of work. \\n\\nMetadata can be included in the file itself (if the file format allows it), as separate files, or in the form of some other documents. When sourcing data, always make a note of where the data come from. This is especially true if getting data online as it is very easy to download data and then forget where they come from. Detailed note-taking is part of the job of the data analyst (and that of any scientist!). \\n\\nWhen metadata is included in the file directly, this typically comes as a header, or in a specified location in the file. The netCDF format has rules for how/where to include metadata, which is one of the reason why netCDF data are particularly useful and popular in climate science. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 9}}]",

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices.

If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\\n\\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \\n\\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement.

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902702944729, 'score': 0.7076863, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_9', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'task.

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753903424963171, 'score': 0.6543939, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_33_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '**Masks**: `Masks` are often used in climate science data to separate data from different regions (e.g. ocean vs land, etc.).

Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424804905, 'score': 0.6273586, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_42_code', 'type': 'code', 'content': \"#!/usr/bin/env python\\nimport cdsapi\\n \\nc = cdsapi.Client()\\n \\nc.retrieve(\\n    'reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels',\\n    {\\n        'product_type': 'reanalysis',\\n        'variable': 'temperature',\\n        'pressure_level': '1000',\\n        'year': '2021',\\n        'month': '01',\\n        'day': '01',\\n        'time': '12:00',\\n        'format': 'netcdf',                         # NetCDF\\n        'area'          : [60., -11., 34., 35.],    # Default area is global; provide [North, West, South, East] limits to select an area (here selecting Europe)\\n        'grid'          : [1.0, 1.0],               #  Default atmospheric resolution is 0.25 x 0.25; provie [Latitude/longitude] grid resolution to interpolate data to something else.           \\n    },\\n    'output/ERAtest_subarea_1deg1deg.nc')           # Output file.

    "response": "To work with **ERA5 reanalysis data** in Python using the **Climate Data Store (CDS)**, you can follow these steps, leveraging the `cdsapi` library and key data handling concepts. Below is a structured guide:\n\n\nUse `cdsapi.Client` to fetch data. Example:  \n```python\nimport cdsapi\n\n# Initialize client\nc = cdsapi.Client()\n\n# Retrieve temperature data (e.g., 10:00 UTC on 2021-01-01)\nc.retrieve(\n    'reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels',\n    {\n        'product_type': 'reanalysis',\n        'variable': 'temperature',\n        'pressure_level': '1000',\n        'year': '2021',\n        'month': '01',\n        'day': '01',\n        'time': '12:00',\n        'format': 'netcdf',\n        'area': [60., -11., 34., 35.],  # Europe\n        'grid': [1.0, 1.0],              # 1x1 degree resolution\n    },\n    'output/ERAtest_subarea_1deg1deg.nc'\n)\n```\n\n**Key Notes**:\n- **Format**: GRIB data is on a non-standard grid (e.g., `[-90, 90]` latitude, `[0, 360]` longitude). NetCDF data is interpolated to a regular grid.\n- **Missing Values**: Default behavior masks `missing_value`/`_FillValue`, but you can force unmasking with `Dataset.set_auto_mask`.\n\n\n- **GRIB Data**:  \n  - Native grid geometry (e.g., `[-90, 90]` latitude, `[0, 360]` longitude).  \n  - Requires manual regridding for analysis (e.g., using `xarray` or `netCDF4`).\n- **NetCDF Data**:  \n  - Automatically interpolated to `[-180, 180]` longitude (via `netCDF4`'s `set_auto_mask`).",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

The signal can be additive, with trends, periods, and errors, e.g. $X_t=T_t+S_t+E_t$, or multiplicative, e.g. $X_t=T_t \\\\cdot S_t \\\\cdot E_t$, where the amplitude of variations of the data could be changing through time. \\n\\nThere are many types of models for time series data, each of which can take various forms and represent different stochastic processes. However, three broad classes are very common and of practical importance: \\n1.  the autoregressive (AR) models, \\n2.  the integrated (I) models, and \\n3.  the moving average (MA) models. \\n   \\nThese three types of models all depend linearly on previous data points (other classes of models exist), and use that information to make a forecast into the future. One is generally interested in [developing these models to forecast](https://medium.com/wegaw/time-series-forecasting-in-python-from-zero-to-neural-networks-in-only-a-month-8e12d6a6e2f4), statistically, the (possibly future) behaviour of the data.

    "response": "The provided text snippets discuss critical challenges and considerations in climate modeling, emphasizing the limitations of models, the importance of data assimilation, and the complexities of interpreting model outputs. Here's a structured summary:\n\n   - **Uncertainty in Parameterization**: Models struggle to capture complex interactions (e.g., the effect of \"Z\" on climate vs. \"W\") due to incomplete physics or unresolved processes.  \n   - **Inconsistency and Fitting**: Models are \"wrong\" and \"incomplete,\" with free parameters that may not align with observed data. Fitting models to data can be misleading, as it may not reflect true physical processes.  \n   - **Model vs. Data**: While models can reproduce mean states, they often fail to capture variability or spatial/temporal patterns. Data assimilation is critical to improve model accuracy.\n\n   - **Use of Model Results**: Model outputs (e.g., climate states) are valuable for understanding historical and current climate patterns, even if they aren't perfect. They are useful for forecasting past/ present conditions.  \n   - **Avoiding \"Right\" Models**: Models are inherently incomplete, and claiming they are \"right\" is unrealistic. Their usefulness lies in their ability to simulate processes, not to perfectly replicate data.\n\n   - **Stationarity and Detrending**: Techniques like stationarity and detrending are used to analyze time series data. Non-stationary data (e.g., seasonal cycles) require special handling to avoid misleading conclusions.  \n   - **Model Robustness**: Models that capture spatial and temporal patterns well may still be offset, highlighting the need for validation against observational data.\n\n   - **Model Interpretation**: Even imperfect models are essential for climate science, as they provide insights into system behavior, even if they don’t perfectly match observations.  \n   - **Data Assimilation**: Techniques like 4DVAR (data assimilation) help refine model parameters, improving their ability to reproduce observed data.\n\n- **Models are imperfect**: They are \"wrong\" and \"incomplete,\" requiring careful validation and interpretation.  \n- **Data assimilation is critical**: Using model outputs to understand past climate patterns and improve forecasts, even if models aren’t perfect.  \n- **Complexity of climate systems**: Models must account for unresolved processes, variability, and non-linear interactions, making them challenging to validate but essential for scientific progress.\n\nThis highlights the balance between model accuracy and the need for robust data assimilation to extract meaningful insights from climate simulations.",

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \\n\\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe (\\'18\\' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \\n\\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that\\'s a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \\n\\nAlthough UKCP18 is \\'just\\' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\\n\\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\\n\\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn\\'t contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \\n\\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\\n\\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \\n\\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\\n\\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \\nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \\n\\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \\n\\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \\n\\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \\n\\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\\n3. Output: Data only\\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\\n   \\nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \\n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \\n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \\n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \\n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can\\'t differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \\n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that\\'s a lot of data!).\\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \\n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \\n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \\n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don\\'t close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \\n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \\n\\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\\n\\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \\n\\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we\\'ll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\\n\\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 46}}, {'id': 1753901956993712, 'score': 0.6251491, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_4', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ionModel data: we do what the @#$ we want J!•…as long aswe can calculate it and analyze it•… and are aware of model flaws!\\nUsing climate models: attributionhttps://www.worldweatherattribution.org\\nhttps://www.swissre.com/media/news-releases/nr-20191219-global-catastrophes-estimate.htmlWhose faultis it?Who pays for it?Catastrophe-related insured losses (1970-2019)\\n\\nClimate extremes and climate risk•Magnitude•Frequency•Duration•Spatial extent•Whatvariable?–T, Precipitation, winds, sea level, etc.•H', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf', 'chunk_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753903424262111, 'score': 0.62332886, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_38_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='reanalysis'></a>\\n\\n# Reanalysis products\\n\\n![C3S](img/c3s-logo.png)\\n![ECMWF](img/logo-ecmwf.png) \\n\\n[*ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables.

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753901956781118, 'score': 0.6226663, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_5', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'umans•Infrastructures•Agriculture•Biodiversity•Landscape•GDP•Administration•Policy•…\\nThe business (and opportunities) of climate\\nhttps://www.metoffice.gov.uk\\nhttps://cervest.earth\\nhttps://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/campaigns/esg-analysis\\nhttps://www.ukclimaterisk.org\\nhttps://www.ibm.com/uk-en/products/environmental-intelligence-suitehttps://www.rms.com/climate-change\\nBusiness riskand climate analyticshttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00984-6… an emerging field!

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902300429530, 'score': 0.66224986, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_6', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ce scales of interest–Integration time step–Spatial resolution of the grid–Duration of model run–Decisions about time/space scales also translate into “filtering” the equations •(parts of the equations can be neglected and the equations simplified –some physics can be neglected/simplified)\\nWhy model climate?\\n\\nWeather and climate –bridging the gap\\n\\n\\nWhat are coupledclimatemodels?\\n\\nA few key major coupling mechanisms between the ocean and the atmosphere\\nThe “coupler” is the heart of climate models', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 6}}, {'id': 1753902702794239, 'score': 0.65527856, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_8', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'cool and warm the climateThe microphysics responsible for cloud formation is not well understoodThe grid cells in models are much much bigger than time/space scales relevant for cloud physicsÞMagnitude/location of rain events is hard to predict wellÞThat information is useful though!\\nComparing models with data•What is a data point?

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}]",

    "response": "When working with climate models, especially those involving data from sources like the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)’s Climate Data Store (CDS), understanding the trade-offs between resolution, computational resources, and model accuracy is critical. Here’s a structured overview of key considerations:\n\n\n- **Higher Resolution**: \n  - **Pros**: Provides finer spatial and temporal detail (e.g., 0.1°x0.1° for ERA5-Land). \n  - **Cons**: Increases data volume, computational load, and storage requirements. \n  - **Use Case**: Ideal for local studies (e.g., regional climate impacts, extreme events) where high-resolution data is needed.\n- **Lower Resolution**:\n  - **Pros**: Reduces computational burden, allows for coarser datasets (e.g., 1°x1° for ocean waves). \n  - **Cons**: May miss local variations or fine-scale patterns. \n  - **Use Case**: Suitable for global-scale analyses or when focusing on specific regions (e.g., avoiding global coverage for efficiency).\n\n\n- **Model Imperfection**:\n  - Models are **incomplete** and **simplified**, so \"right\" results depend on context. \n  - **Key Challenges**:\n    - **Internal Variability**: Natural climate fluctuations (e.g., El Niño) can mask \"forced\" responses.\n    - **Ensemble Simulations**: Multiple runs help assess model reliability (e.g., 100s of ensemble runs for robustness).\n    - **Error Metrics**: \n      - **Relative Error** varies by variable (e.g., mean temperature vs. variability).\n      - **Model vs. Data**: Some models may excel at mean states but fail at variability or spatial patterns.\n\n\n- **CDS API**:\n  - **Usage**: Download ERA5 data with adjustable resolutions (e.g., 1°x1° for ocean waves).\n  - **Example**: \n    ```python\n    # Example script to reduce resolution and select a sub-domain\n    from cdsapi import CDSClient\n    client = CDSClient()\n    data = client.get('reanalysis-era5-pressure-monthly', \n                       start_date='2020-01-01', \n                       end_date='2020-12-31', \n                       grid='1degree')\n    ```\n  - **Benefits**: Efficiently manage data without full global resolution.\n\n\n- **Choose the Right Model**:\n  - **Variables**: Match the model to the variable of interest (e.g., temperature, precipitation).\n  - **Process**: Use simpler models where possible (e.g., avoid full coupling for non-coupled variables).\n  - **Ensemble Analysis**: Use multi-model means to reduce uncertainty (e.g., \"less than mean\" error for certain variables).\n\n\n- **Accept Imperfection**: \n  - Models cannot perfectly replicate real-world data. Probabilistic answers (e.g., \"likely\" or \"range\") are often necessary.\n  -",
    "reference": "Reliability should be assessed based on model purpose, accuracy in representing key processes, consistency with observations, sensitivity to parameters, and ensemble robustness. High resolution and realistic parameterization improve confidence but don’t eliminate uncertainties."

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}]",

    "response": "The provided text snippets discuss critical challenges and methodologies in climate modeling and time series analysis. Below is a structured summary of key insights:\n\n\n- **Model Limitations**:  \n  - Climate models struggle to accurately simulate effects like the \"effect of Z\" (unquantified interactions) on climate, highlighting inherent uncertainties.  \n  - Models are \"incomplete\" and \"wrong\" due to simplifications, data scarcity, and the complexity of natural systems.  \n  - **Key Takeaways**:  \n    - Models require **deep scientific understanding** of physical processes (e.g., cloud microphysics, atmospheric dynamics).  \n    - **Data quality** is critical: uncertainties in observations (e.g., measurement errors, environmental variability) must be carefully characterized.  \n\n- **Data-Model Interplay**:  \n  - Models are often **assimilated with observations** (e.g., reanalysis products), blending \"just models\" and \"just observations.\"  \n  - **Observational System Simulation Experiments (OSSE)** emphasize the need to validate models against real-world data.  \n\n\n- **Stationarity**:  \n  - Time series data must be **stationary** (constant mean and variance) for reliable modeling. Techniques like differencing (e.g., ARIMA) are used to achieve stationarity.  \n\n- **Autocorrelation & Correlation**:  \n  - **Autocorrelation** (ACF) measures the correlation between values at different time lags. Tools like the **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** and **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** analyze frequency-domain patterns.  \n\n- **Model Types**:  \n  - **AR (AutoRegressive)**: Models current values based on past values.  \n  - **MA (Moving Average)**: Models current values based on past errors.  \n  - **ARMA (p,q)**: Combines AR and MA components.  \n  - **ARIMA (p,d,q)(P,D,Q)**: ARIMA extends ARMA with differencing (d) to handle non-stationary data.  \n\n- **Applications**:  \n  - Used in climate studies to analyze trends, seasonal patterns, and forecast future conditions.  \n  - Crucial for **data assimilation** (e.g., 4DVAR) and **reanalysis products** (e.g., CMIP6 datasets).  \n\n\n- **Uncertainty Management**:  \n  - Quantify **measurement errors**, **environmental variability**, and **model uncertainties**.  \n  - Emphasize **comprehensive uncertainty characterization** to avoid overconfidence in predictions.  \n\n- **Data-Model Integration**:  \n  - Balancing **model simplicity** with **data richness** to avoid overfitting.  \n  - Prioritizing **observational data** (e.g., satellite, in-situ measurements) to validate models.  \n\n\n- **Model Validation**:  \n  - Use **reanalysis products** (e.g., ERA-5, MERRA) to compare model outputs with observations.",

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point.

Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\\n\\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \\n\\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\\\left(1-exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-h}{ra}\\\\right)\\\\right)+n_{(0,\\\\infty)}\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\n    \\n2.

It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$. At this point, one can either compute the **spatial covariance**\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nC(k \\\\Delta h)=\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k\\\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nfrom which we can compute the **correlogram**, which is simply the spatial covariance normalized by the data variance (at $k=0$) so as to limit its range to $\\\\pm 1$,\\n\\n\\\\label{eq:corelogram}\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\rho(k \\\\Delta  h)=\\\\frac{C(k \\\\Delta h)}{C(0)}=\\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k \\\\Delta  h)d(x_i)}{\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^m(d(x_i)^2)}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nor look at the mean squared difference and form the **semivariogram**\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\gamma(k \\\\Delta  h)=\\\\frac{1}{2m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^m\\\\left(d(x_i+k\\\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\\\right)^2.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nThe functional forms $C(h)$, $\\\\rho(h)$ or $\\\\gamma(h)$ of these binned, discrete estimates is obtained simply by plotting $C(k\\\\Delta h)$, $\\\\rho(k\\\\Delta  h)$ or $\\\\gamma(k\\\\Delta  h)$ as a function of $k\\\\Delta h$ and by fitting a polynomial throught the results that ensures strictly positive values of $C(h)$, $\\\\rho(h)$ or $\\\\gamma(h)$ for any $h$.\\n\\nNote that the corelogram in geostatistics is very similar to the autocorrelation function used in time-series analysis.

For any given query point $\\\\vec{x}_0$, the necessary correction is calcuated as a weighted sum of contributions from the available samples $x_i$. The big question is what values should the weight corresponding to each sample have? Answering this question is not easy - it is basically the whole point of kriging. The answer will depend on any additional constraints that one applies on these weights and on any additional properties one wishes the field $F$ or $D$ to have (stationarity of various moments, isotropy, etc.). Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}, {'id': 1753903968752811, 'score': 0.61533356, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_21_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='fitting'></a>\\n# Surface fitting\\n\\nThe interpolation techniques described above work very well when the space is relatively well-sampled, when one does not want to extrapolate beyond the convex hull and in the absence of variability or uncertainties associated the control points.

    "response": "The provided contexts discuss key concepts in **climate modeling**, focusing on **model evaluation**, **uncertainty**, and **data assimilation**. Here's a structured summary:\n\n\n- **Model Performance**: \n  - Models are evaluated by comparing their outputs (e.g., temperature, precipitation) to observed data. However, models are **incomplete** and **inaccurate** due to physical limitations (e.g., cloud microphysics, unresolved scales).\n  - **Internal Variability**: Natural fluctuations in climate systems (e.g., weather patterns) are inherent to models, even when external forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases) are applied.\n  - **Forced Response**: Models simulate the climate system under external influences (e.g., CO₂ emissions), but their accuracy depends on how well they capture these forcings.\n\n- **Ensemble Simulations**:\n  - Multiple models or runs are used to account for uncertainty. For example:\n    - **Ensemble members** simulate different initial conditions or parameterizations.\n    - **Ensemble averages** reduce uncertainty by averaging results.\n    - This is critical for predicting climate change impacts, as models may differ in their simulations of processes like cloud formation or precipitation.\n\n\n- **Data vs. Model Outputs**:\n  - Observations (e.g., satellite data, ground measurements) are compared to model results. Models may produce **\"point\" outputs** (e.g., temperature at a specific location/time), which may not align with observational samples (e.g., spatial or temporal resolution).\n  - **Data Assimilation** (e.g., 4DVAR, MOC) improves model accuracy by integrating observations into simulations. This reduces uncertainty in predictions.\n\n- **Role of Observations**:\n  - Observations (e.g., weather forecasts, satellite data) are used to **\"assimilate\"** into models, creating **reanalysis products** (e.g., ECMWF Reanalysis).\n  - These products are critical for weather forecasting and climate studies, as they bridge the gap between models and real-world data.\n\n\n- **Scale Mismatch**:\n  - Climate models use **large grid cells** (e.g., 100 km) to simulate the atmosphere, but processes like **cloud formation** occur at much smaller scales (e.g., 1 km). This makes it difficult to predict phenomena like **rain events** accurately.\n  - **Microphysics** (cloud formation) is a major area of uncertainty in climate models.\n\n- **Model Limitations**:\n  - Models cannot fully capture all physical processes, leading to **systematic errors**. For example:\n    - **Internal variability** (natural",

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903424262111, 'score': 0.6589072, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_38_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='reanalysis'></a>\\n\\n# Reanalysis products\\n\\n![C3S](img/c3s-logo.png)\\n![ECMWF](img/logo-ecmwf.png) \\n\\n[*ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables.

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424963171, 'score': 0.65265584, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_33_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '**Masks**: `Masks` are often used in climate science data to separate data from different regions (e.g. ocean vs land, etc.).

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753902702662417, 'score': 0.6421946, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_10', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ls that are ‘fitted’ to data•Some model parameters are tuned to fit–Question is what to fit/how?

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753903424269054, 'score': 0.6554224, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_41_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': 'One can also modify the CDS API download script using optional post-processing arguments.\\n\\nFor example, one can use the `grid` option to change the grid on which the data are presented.  \\n\\nThe native grid of ERA data on CDS is 0.25°x0.25° (atmosphere), 0.5°x0.5° (ocean waves) for variables, while derived quantities, such as mean and variance are on a 0.5°x0.5° (atmosphere) and a coarser 1°x1° (ocean waves).

These grid resolutions will be provided by default, but perhaps one does not needs such high resolution for our application, and one may only be interested in a subset of the global dataset, in which case, it makes sense to minimize the local computational and storage burden and to use the CDS API to provide a coarser and more focused data file. \\n\\nThe following script shows an [example](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+download+ERA5#HowtodownloadERA5-3-DownloadingonlineERA5familydatathroughtheCDSwebinterface), where the resolution is decreased to 1 degree by 1 degree and a sub-domain is selected (in case one does not need global coverage): ', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 41}}]",

    "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out what the user is asking here. They provided a bunch of text related to concepts in data science, geospatial analysis, and simulations. The task is to find the entity that has the highest similarity to \"grid\" based on the given context.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context provided. The user mentioned several entities with their types and descriptions. The main ones are \"grid\" with a similarity of 0.793, \"rootgrp\" with 0.715, and others like \"dimensions\" (0.695), \"pcolormesh\" (0.683), etc.\n\nThe user is asking for the entity that's most similar to \"grid\". From the context, \"grid\" is described as \"network of coordinates\". Looking at the entities, \"grids\" is mentioned with a similarity of 0.000, which is lower. Then there's \"dimensions\" which is about sizes of variables in NetCDF files, but that's a different concept. \n\nWait, the entity \"grid\" in the context is part of the \"rootgrp\" which creates various groups like \"ftemp\", \"lon\", \"lat\", etc. But the user is asking about the grid concept, which is a network of coordinates. The closest entity here is \"grids\" but with a similarity of 0.000. However, maybe there's another entity that's more related.\n\nLooking at the list again, \"spatial data\" is mentioned, but that's a different concept. The \"grid\" in the context is part of the \"rootgrp\" which creates \"lon\" and \"lat\" as part of the dimensions. So maybe the answer is \"grids\" even though the similarity is 0.000? Wait, no, the user is asking for the entity with the highest similarity. The \"grid\" in the context is a network of coordinates, and the closest entity might be \"grids\" but with 0.000. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the user's context includes \"grids\" with a similarity of 0.000, but maybe there's another entity. Let me check again. The entities listed include \"spatial data\" (0.668), \"scattered data\" (0.000), \"gridded data\" (0.000), \"interpolation\" (0.665), etc. The \"grid\" in the context is a network of coordinates, which is similar to \"grids\" but with 0.000. Wait, maybe the answer is \"grids\" even though the similarity is 0.000? But that's not possible because the user is asking for the highest similarity. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The user's context includes \"grid\" as a concept with similarity 0.793. Let me check again. The user's context says:\n\nEntity: grid (Type: concept, Similarity: 0.793)\nDescription: network of coordinates\n\nSo the highest similarity is \"grid\" itself. But the user is asking for the entity that's similar to \"grid\". So the answer would be \"grid\" itself. But the user is providing a list of entities, and the question is to find the entity with the highest similarity. However, in the context, \"grid\" is listed as an entity with similarity 0.793. But the user is asking for the entity that's similar to \"grid\", so the answer would be \"grid\" itself. But maybe the user is looking for another entity. Wait, the user's question is phrased as \"Entity: grid (Type: concept, Similarity: 0.793) ...\". So the answer would be \"grid\" as the entity with the highest similarity. But the user is asking for the entity that's similar to \"grid\", so the answer is \"grid\" itself. However, in the context, the user might be expecting another entity. Wait, maybe there's another entity with a higher similarity. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the entities, the highest similarity is \"grid\" with 0.793. The next is \"rootgrp\" with 0.715. So if the question is to find the entity with the highest similarity to \"grid\", then \"grid\" is the answer. But the user is providing a list of entities, and the answer would be \"grid\" itself. However, the user might be expecting a different answer. Wait, maybe the user is asking for the entity that is similar to \"grid\" in the context, which is \"grid\" itself. But the answer should be \"grid\" as the entity with the highest similarity. However, the user's context includes \"grid\" as an entity, so the answer is",

    "response": "Climate models are complex systems that attempt to simulate Earth's climate and its responses to external factors (e.g., greenhouse gas concentrations, solar radiation). However, they are inherently **incomplete** and **inaccurate** due to the vast number of variables and processes involved. Key points from the provided content include:\n\n\n- **Incompleteness**: Models cannot account for all physical processes (e.g., microphysics of clouds, ocean dynamics, or biological factors). For example, the effect of \"Z\" (a variable not explicitly modeled) may influence climate, but its impact is **unquantified** in many models.\n- **Data Assimilation**: Models often \"fit\" to observational data (e.g., using 4DVAR or OSSE), but this introduces uncertainties. The \"best\" model output may not reflect reality due to imperfect data or assumptions.\n- **Sensitivity to Inputs**: Models are sensitive to initial conditions, parameter choices, and external forcings. Small changes can lead to significant differences in predictions (e.g., \"climate sensitivity\").\n\n\n- **Scale and Resolution**: Models vary in spatial and temporal resolution. Higher resolution improves accuracy but increases computational cost.\n- **Ensemble Simulations**: To account for uncertainty, models run with different initial conditions or parameter sets (ensembles). This helps quantify how sensitive predictions are to assumptions.\n- **Microphysics and Feedbacks**: Processes like cloud formation, radiation, and ocean heat uptake are critical but often simplified in models, leading to potential biases.\n\n\n- **Model Complexity**: Balancing detail (e.g., resolving every cloud) with computational feasibility is a trade-off. Simplifications are necessary to make models tractable.\n- **Validation**: Models are validated against historical data and observational studies. However, their accuracy depends on how well they capture real-world processes.\n- **Interpretation**: Even with high-resolution models, predictions are probabilistic. Uncertainties must be communicated transparently.\n\n\n- **\"Models are perfect\"**: No model can replicate Earth's climate exactly. They are **approximations**.\n- **\"Models are unchanging\"**: Parameters (e.g., greenhouse gas concentrations) are adjusted to match observed data, but this introduces variability.\n- **\"Models are irrelevant\"**: They are essential for understanding climate change, predicting future scenarios, and guiding policy.\n\n\n- **Models are imperfect**: They cannot account for all variables or processes, and their accuracy depends on data quality and assumptions.\n- **Ensemble",

Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\\n\\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \\n\\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\\\left(1-exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-h}{ra}\\\\right)\\\\right)+n_{(0,\\\\infty)}\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\n    \\n2.

It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902702944729, 'score': 0.69796765, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_9', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'task.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option.

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903968777554, 'score': 0.65402675, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_23_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '#### Mathematical formulation (only the basic setup of the problem, not the solution)\\n\\nThe general problem is to compute an estimate $\\\\hat{F}(\\\\vec{x}_0,t)$ of the true field $F(\\\\vec{x}_0,t)$ at query position $\\\\vec{x}_0$ from a finite number of scattered observations $f(\\\\vec{x}_n,t)$ taken at locations $\\\\vec{x}_n$, with $n=1,2,...,N$.\\n\\nIf we consider a snap-shot in time, i.e. dropping the time index $t$, the generalized kriging problem can be stated as\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\hat{F}(\\\\vec{x}_0)=\\\\overline{F(\\\\vec{x})}+\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^Nb(x_i)(f(x_i)-\\\\overline{f(x_i)})\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nwhere the overbars denote the expectation value (i.e. the mean) and the $b(x_i)$ are yet unspecified weighting coefficients for each data point $x_i$, subject to $\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^Nb(x_i)=1$.\\n\\nThe generalized kriging problem equation above means that to predict the value of the field $\\\\hat{F}(\\\\vec{x}_0)$ at a query location $\\\\vec{x}_0$, a good guess is to start with the mean (or some known structure) of the overall field $\\\\overline{F(\\\\vec{x})}$, to which we add corrections.

The big question is what values should the weight corresponding to each sample have? Answering this question is not easy - it is basically the whole point of kriging. The answer will depend on any additional constraints that one applies on these weights and on any additional properties one wishes the field $F$ or $D$ to have (stationarity of various moments, isotropy, etc.). Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}, {'id': 1753901956747387, 'score': 0.653484, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_1', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.4.

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753902702944729, 'score': 0.64100647, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_9', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'task.

Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}]"

[MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424228032, 'score': 0.6483367, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_43_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '### The CDS Toolbox\\n\\nAn extention to the CDS API is the [CDS Toolbox](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/toolbox/doc/index.html).

This series may be ordered in space (e.g. down a stratigraphic section) or in time (e.g. over the past 100 years). In either case, these are known as `time series`, and the term `time-series analysis` is used to describe the application of quantitative methods to discover patterns in the data. \\n\\nThe series variable can be defined either by a rank-order or by a quantitative measure of position along the series axis (time or space). To illustrate this, consider a tree rings.  A rank-order series is defined by the order that the rings appear, from inside to outside: first, second, third, ..., last.  A quantitative sequence measure, on the other hand, can be defined if each ring is dated, with ages: $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$, ..., $t_N$. (For tree rings, this is easy as one ring = one year.)\\n\\nA time-series consists of an observation at each entry in the rank-order or measured-time list.  This measurement can also be qualitative or quantitative.  As an example of the former, we might have a record of the presence or absence of a certain fossil-type in each layer of the stratigraphic sequence. The latter type of time-series, composed of quantitative observations, might be the height of water in a lake, the lateral displacement of a GPS station, or, in the case of tree rings, maybe the mass-fraction of a pollutant in the wood.\\n\\n[Time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series) data can be equally spaced or not, but if not, then extra care must be taken to analyze them. Time-series refer to sequence of discrete in time data. This also means that the points have a relationship with one-another, i.e some points cannot exist before, or after other points. That organization, containted in the order, can be exploited to learn more about real-world processes. \\n\\nData where time (or rank order, or sequential order) doesn't matter are sometimes called `cross sectional data`. These are sets of data observed at a single time, or where time has no meaning. \\n\\nTypically, time series data have the following form: \\n1. a time or index variable, or (when unlucky), multiple columns that have to be combined to create a meaningful time variable (this is often the case, when year, month, day, time, etc. are in different columns)\\n2. other columns of data with measurements/values of interest.\\n\\nNote that datasets can of course also contain [both cross-sectional and time series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsroWpkUuYI) information, in which case analysis can be performed for each time step, and across time steps, yielding for very rich analysis. For example, we could have data that measure the temporal evolution of some environmental variables in various locations. One could therefore compare locations spatially, at each time point, look at the evolution of the data at each station, and also do both. That is, time series analysis may not necessarily only concern 1D datasets, but also 2D, 3D, or ND datasets. \\n\\nIn general, we will consider time-series composed of $N$ entries indexed by an integer $i$ that goes from 1 to $N$.  For each value of $i$ we will have a measure of the position (e.g.~time), $t_i$, and a measure of some quantity at that time, $q_i$.  Hence a general time-series can be represented as\\n$\\n  t_1,\\\\, t_2,\\\\, t_3,\\\\,...,\\\\,t_{N-1},\\\\,t_N; \\\\\\\\\\n  q_1,\\\\, q_2,\\\\, q_3,\\\\,...,\\\\,q_{N-1},\\\\,q_N.\\n$\\n\\nA primary consideration in analysing a time-series is whether its entries are `regularly spaced`.  Regular spacing means that there is a constant difference between $t_{i+1}$ and $t_i$:\\n\\n$\\n  t_{i+1} - t_i = \\\\Delta t\\\\text{, const. for all }i.\\n$\\n\\nThe spacing between successive measurements, $\\\\Delta t$, could be a microsecond, or a metre, or a million years; the important point is that the same spacing applies to any pair of consecutive entries in the series.\\n\\nIf $\\\\Delta t$ is not constant, then interpolation methods can be used to interpolate the original data onto a constant grid, with constant spacing. \\n\\nThere are many ways to interpolate data, but not one best way. It is up to the analyst to pick the 'best' way and this will depend on the data distribution, data type, and on the research objectives. It is hard to know a-priori what works best for a given case and the analyst will need to check that her/his choice will not critically affect the conclusion of the study. \\n\\n`Linear interpolation` is often an excellent first choice. It is simple and fast. However, because it relies on simply interpolating [between neighboring points using strait line segments](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter17.02-Linear-Interpolation.html), the interpolated product could be 'jagged'. Depending on the smoothness of the true process sampled by the time series, `higher-order polynomials` or `splines` could be used, or, as discuss later, a `loess/lowess` fit. \\n\\nPython provides many functions for **interpolation**, for instance from `scipy.interpolate`, such as [`interp1d`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.interp1d.html), [`interp2d`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.interp2d.html#scipy.interpolate.interp2d) for 2D grids for linear and bilinear interpolation, or [`UnivariateSpline`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline.html#scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline) or [`BivariateSpline`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.BivariateSpline.html#scipy.interpolate.BivariateSpline) for smoother options.

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424509295, 'score': 0.6630035, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 01- Introduction to climate data and climate models\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n## Contents\\n- [Lectures](#lectures)\\n- [Question](#question)\\n- [ESMValTool](#ESMValTool)\\n- [Sources of climate data](#climatedata)\\n- [CEDA](#CEDA)\\n- [File formats](#fileformat)\\n- [Metadata](#metadata)\\n- [NetCDF](#NetCDF)\\n- [NCO](#NCO)\\n- [Reanalysis products](#reanalysis)\\n- [Climate services UKCP18](#ukcp18)\\n  \\n## Learning outcomes\\n1.

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902702944729, 'score': 0.6906973, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_9', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'task.

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units.

NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\\n\\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \\n\\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\\n\\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable.

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902702944729, 'score': 0.68627816, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_9', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'task.

While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+.

NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\\n\\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \\n\\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\\n\\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\\n\\n\\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)).

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902702944729, 'score': 0.6870794, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_9', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'task.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \\n\\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe (\\'18\\' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \\n\\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that\\'s a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \\n\\nAlthough UKCP18 is \\'just\\' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\\n\\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\\n\\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn\\'t contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \\n\\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\\n\\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \\n\\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\\n\\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \\nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \\n\\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \\n\\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \\n\\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \\n\\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\\n3. Output: Data only\\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\\n   \\nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \\n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \\n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \\n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \\n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can\\'t differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \\n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that\\'s a lot of data!).\\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \\n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \\n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \\n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don\\'t close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \\n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \\n\\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\\n\\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \\n\\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we\\'ll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\\n\\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are!

    "response": "The provided content involves a detailed exploration of **climate modeling**, **data retrieval**, and **uncertainty analysis**, with a focus on practical workflows and theoretical foundations. Here's a structured breakdown:\n\n\n\n- **Physics and Discretization**: \n  - Models rely on **numerical methods** to solve complex equations (e.g., Navier-Stokes, heat transfer, fluid dynamics). \n  - **Discretization** involves dividing space (e.g., grid cells) and time (e.g., time steps) into manageable units (e.g., 5 km × 5 km grid cells, hourly time steps).\n  - **Numerical Stability** and **computational costs** are critical factors in choosing grid sizes, time steps, and numerical schemes (e.g., finite differences, finite volumes).\n\n- **Ensembles**:\n  - Models simulate multiple **ensemble members** (e.g., 12 runs) to account for uncertainty. Each run uses slightly different initial conditions or parameters.\n  - For example, the `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000` ensemble is used here to analyze precipitation trends under the RCP8.5 scenario.\n\n- **Data Formats**:\n  - Output is often in **CF-NetCDF** (Climate and Forecasting NetCDF), a standard format for scientific data, ensuring compatibility with analysis tools.\n\n\n- **Workflow**:\n  1. **Account Setup**: Register for the UKCP18 web interface (requires a password manager for security).\n  2. **Request Parameters**:\n     - **Scenario**: RCP8.5 (business-as-usual emissions).\n     - **Time Periods**: 1981–2000 (historical) and 2061–2080 (future).\n     - **Output**: Hourly precipitation data (subdaily resolution).\n     - **Grid Cell**: South Kensington (5 km × 5 km).\n     - **Format**: CF-NetCDF (for automation).\n  3. **Job Label**: `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly` (tracks the job).\n\n- **Challenges**:\n  - **Data Volume**: 1.4 MB for a single grid cell (small for the UK, but large for full UK analysis).\n  - **Uncertainty**: Must analyze multiple ensemble members (e.g., 12 runs) to assess variability.\n\n\n- **Security**: Use a password manager to avoid reusing credentials across services.\n- **Automation**: CF-NetCDF files are ideal for scripting (e.g., using Python tools like `xarray` or `netCDF4`).\n- **Analysis**: \n  - Compare historical (1981–2000) and future (2061–2080) precipitation",

    "response": "1. **Model Dynamics and Discretization**  \n   - **Discretization Parameters**: Critical for accuracy, including spatial (Dx, Dy, Dz) and temporal (Dt) resolutions, stencil size, and numerical stability. Smaller steps improve resolution but increase computational cost.  \n   - **Subgrid-Scale Processes**: Explicit inclusion of subgrid-scale phenomena (e.g., eddies, overflows) is essential for capturing detailed physical behavior, though it adds complexity.  \n   - **Topography and Bathymetry**: Better representation improves accuracy in fluid dynamics, especially near mountains, islands, and seamounts.  \n   - **Parameterization vs. Resolution**: Balancing between resolving small-scale processes (e.g., cloud formation) and simplifying larger-scale dynamics (e.g., ocean currents) is a trade-off.  \n\n2. **Numerical Stability and Diffusion**  \n   - **Numerical Diffusion**: All models suffer from diffusion, with different schemes (e.g., forward vs. backward Euler) having unique strengths and weaknesses.  \n   - **Stability Challenges**: Deviations from expected behavior highlight numerical instability, requiring careful tuning of discretization and solver parameters.  \n\n3. **Model Performance and Evaluation**  \n   - **Metrics**: Evaluating models requires balancing simplicity (e.g., fewer equations) with accuracy. Metrics like error relative to multi-model averages or internal variability are critical.  \n   - **Ensemble Simulations**: Generating numerous ensembles (e.g., 100s of runs) provides robustness by accounting for natural variability and forced responses.  \n   - **Data-Intensive Tasks**: Simpler models (e.g., coupled only for specific processes) are preferable for efficiency, while complex models (e.g., full climate simulations) require extensive data processing.  \n\n4. **Practical Considerations**  \n   - **Trade-offs**: Model complexity vs. computational cost, data requirements, and the need for accurate initial and boundary conditions.  \n   - **Validation**: Comparing model outputs to observational data (e.g., surface temperature anomalies) is essential for refining parameters and improving predictive accuracy.  \n\nClimate models rely on precise discretization, careful parameterization, and robust numerical schemes to balance accuracy and computational feasibility. Evaluating models involves assessing their performance against real-world data, accounting for natural variability, and leveraging ensemble simulations to validate results. The challenge lies in optimizing complexity while ensuring numerical stability and meaningful insights into climate dynamics.",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}]",

In oceanography, for example, a simplified version of the technique has crept through under the name objective mapping. \\n\\nIn jargon, kriging is essentially a fitting process constrained by an underlying Gauss-Markov process model, itself controlled by prior covariances. This latter statement could be translated as follows.\\n\\nJust as time-series were characterized by an autocorrelation function indicating that the values at time $t$ were not necessarily independent from previous values at times $t-\\\\tau$, points in space $(x_i,y_i)$ can also be thought of as correlated with any number of neighboring points $(x_k,y_k)$, $(x_l,y_l)$, etc. In time-series analysis and geostatistics, a Gauss-Markov regression model is a means of specifying the degree of correlation (i.e the memory) between neighboring points. The degree of influence that a point has on another point (i.e. the memory) is specified by means of a covariance matrix.

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}]",

    "response": "The provided text discusses key concepts in climate modeling, reanalysis products (e.g., **ERA5**), and technical challenges related to data resolution, computational costs, and signal processing. Here's a structured summary of the core ideas:\n\n\n- **Definition**: Reanalysis products are **model outputs** that assimilate observational data (e.g., satellite, weather station measurements) to improve accuracy. They are not direct observations but interpolated to create a continuous, globally consistent dataset.\n- **Key Features**:\n  - **ERA5** (ECMWF): \n    - **Resolution**: 30 km grid, 137 atmospheric levels (up to 80 km height).\n    - **Assimilation**: Uses **4D-var** (a data assimilation technique) to align with observations.\n    - **Updates**: Monthly (quality-assured) and daily (preliminary) versions.\n    - **Use Case**: Ideal for long-term climate analysis, weather forecasting, and regional studies.\n- **Distinction from Observations**:\n  - **ERA5** is **not** observations; it is a **model product** that mimics observations but is **not identical** to them. It accounts for model limitations (e.g., computational constraints, physics approximations).\n\n\n- **Resolution Impact**:\n  - **Spatial Resolution**: Higher resolution (e.g., 10 km vs. 30 km) increases **computational cost** exponentially (e.g., 2³ = 8x more calculations for 2x spatial resolution in all dimensions).\n  - **Temporal Resolution**: To maintain numerical stability, higher resolution often requires **decreased time steps** (e.g., 1/100th of the original time step).\n- **Trade-offs**:\n  - **Benefits**: \n    - Improved **numerical accuracy** and **interpolation** (e.g., handling missing data).\n    - Better **spatial/temporal continuity** for climate analysis.\n  - **Costs**: \n    - **Memory**, **time**, and **computational power** increase dramatically with resolution.\n\n\n- **Nyquist Frequency**:\n  - Half of the sampling rate (e.g., 100 Hz → 50 Hz).\n  - **Critical for signal reconstruction**: To capture a sine/cosine wave, at least **2 samples",

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902703457059, 'score': 0.61709, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_6', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'in R.

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753902300429530, 'score': 0.65618706, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_6', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ce scales of interest–Integration time step–Spatial resolution of the grid–Duration of model run–Decisions about time/space scales also translate into “filtering” the equations •(parts of the equations can be neglected and the equations simplified –some physics can be neglected/simplified)\\nWhy model climate?\\n\\nWeather and climate –bridging the gap\\n\\n\\nWhat are coupledclimatemodels?\\n\\nA few key major coupling mechanisms between the ocean and the atmosphere\\nThe “coupler” is the heart of climate models', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 6}}, {'id': 1753902703222464, 'score': 0.64990413, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_12', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'n meanModel performance and deciding which is the best model?Which is the best “Metric” -a judgment call?\\nInternal variability vs “forced” response?Ensemble simulations\\nRun 1, 2, 3 are ‘ensemble’ runsToday, 100s of ensemble runs can be generatedThat’s a lot of data!\\nAveraged surface temperature anomaly\\nWhat model for what process, for what analysis?Choosing the best model product for the jobIf simple works, go simple!

ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902702944729, 'score': 0.6366171, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_9', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'task.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424804905, 'score': 0.7095739, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_42_code', 'type': 'code', 'content': \"#!/usr/bin/env python\\nimport cdsapi\\n \\nc = cdsapi.Client()\\n \\nc.retrieve(\\n    'reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels',\\n    {\\n        'product_type': 'reanalysis',\\n        'variable': 'temperature',\\n        'pressure_level': '1000',\\n        'year': '2021',\\n        'month': '01',\\n        'day': '01',\\n        'time': '12:00',\\n        'format': 'netcdf',                         # NetCDF\\n        'area'          : [60., -11., 34., 35.],    # Default area is global; provide [North, West, South, East] limits to select an area (here selecting Europe)\\n        'grid'          : [1.0, 1.0],               #  Default atmospheric resolution is 0.25 x 0.25; provie [Latitude/longitude] grid resolution to interpolate data to something else.           \\n    },\\n    'output/ERAtest_subarea_1deg1deg.nc')           # Output file.

There are two ways to download data:\\n\\n1. The simplest (if one only need to do this once), is to use the [web interface](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+download+ERA5#HowtodownloadERA5-3-DownloadingonlineERA5familydatathroughtheCDSwebinterface). \\n\\n2. However, one can also download ERA5 via installation and understanding of yet another service and its [API](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+download+ERA5#HowtodownloadERA5-3-DownloadingonlineERA5familydatathroughtheCDSwebinterface), namely, the [Climate Data Store API](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/Climate+Data+Store+%28CDS%29+infrastructure+and+API). (Beware, the installation instructions depend on the operating system). This provides the user with a mechanism to write data request scripts to download files automatically (or as necessary whithin a workflow). \\n\\n#### The CDS API\\n  \\n**Note that before using this service, one must first register for a free CDS account [here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user/register)**. Registration is fast, only a minute. \\n\\nThe next step is to setup the uid:API key detail, as prescribed in the installation instructions. \\n\\nThen install the CDS API itself; follow the instructions [here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to). (Note, this can also be done with [conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/cdsapi): `conda install -c conda-forge cdsapi`.)\\n\\nThe Copernicus Climate Change Service [provides tutorials and training material](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/COPSRV/CDS+web+API+%28cdsapi%29+training) on the CDS API. \\n\\nThe following shows an example of how one can download Air Temperature, here on the 1000 hPa pressure level, for a given time point in both NetCDF or GRIB format. \\n\\nNote that the CDS web interface can be used to build the CDS API download script. In the web interface, in the `Download data` tab, after selecting some files of interest, one can click the button `Show API request` at the bottom left, which will generate a script. This script can then be modified easily as required (for example, to access similar data from different dates - what would be convenient if building a self-updating dashboard, etc.). \\n\\nOne can also study the systematic structure of the ERA archive to build CDS API scripts more [efficiently](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/Climate+Data+Store+%28CDS%29+documentation#ClimateDataStore(CDS)documentation-Efficiencytips). \\n\\nA full list of available variables available for download is provided [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Parameterlistings). \\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 39}}, {'id': 1753903424815332, 'score': 0.62797433, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_6_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '<a id=\\'CEDA\\'></a>\\n\\n### For the UK: Center for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA)\\n\\n![ceda](img/ceda_archive_logo_transp_white_3_h80.png)\\n\\n[CEDA](https://www.ceda.ac.uk) serves the UK environmental science community. It is a component of ESGF. \\n\\nCEDA has two main branches: \\n1. [CEDA-Archive: https://archive.ceda.ac.uk](https://archive.ceda.ac.uk) \\n2. [JASMIN: https://jasmin.ac.uk](https://jasmin.ac.uk)\\n\\n[CEDA-Archive](https://archive.ceda.ac.uk) serves as the national (UK) data centre for atmospheric and earth observation research. It currently holds >18 Petabytes of atmospheric and earth observation data from a variet of sources, such as aircraft campaigns, satellites imagery, automatic weather stations, climate models, etc. \\n\\nCEDA is one of 5 UK data centers, comprising the Environmental Data Service ([EDS](https://nerc.ukri.org/research/sites/environmental-data-service-eds/)), supported by the UK Research and Innovation\\'s National Environmental Research Council (NERC). The 5 centers are \\n1. British Oceanographic Data Centre (Marine), \\n2. CEDA (Atmospheric, Earth Observation, and Solar and space physics), \\n3. Environmental Information Data Centre (Terrestrial and freshwater), \\n4. National Geoscience Data Centre (Geoscience), and \\n5. Polar Data Centre (Polar and cryosphere). \\n   \\nAs the focus is on climate here, CEDA is the most relevant, but it is useful to know of these resources if you end up working in other fields. \\n\\nCEDA also serves as the Data Distribution Center ([DDC](https://www.ipcc-data.org)) for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch)).\\n\\n[JASMIN](https://jasmin.ac.uk) is a data intensive supercomputer for environmental science. It currently supports over 160 projects ranging from climate science and oceanography to air pollution, earthquake deformation or biodiversity studies. JASMIN consists of multi-Petabyte fast storage, co-located with data analysis computing facilities. This would be the \"go-to\" tool for processing large amounts of climate data, which are directly linked to the system (through CEDA). We will here work offline (using local storage), but JASMIN and CEDA are useful resources for anyone working in environmental science in the UK (most nations don\\'t have these facilities - they are rare and valuable!). \\n\\nSince CEDA and JASMIN are linked, the **compute power is linked to the data**, making for an efficient environment for data analysis. \\n\\n#### Getting access\\n\\nObviously, maintaining these facilities has a cost and therefore not all users will have the same access priviledges. Members of educational, academic and research institutions in the UK can often access these infrastructures for free (pending one can demonstrate need and subject to a fair-use policy). Use and access will likely not be free for commercial applications.  \\n\\n**Use your Imperial College London email adresses (or from another UK institution) to register!**\\n\\nIn order to use the CEDA-Archive, it is necessary to first [register for an account](https://services.ceda.ac.uk/cedasite/register/info/). This is generally quick, easy and free.\\n\\nSimilarly, access to JASMIN requires an account, but this involves a more complex multi-step process. First, one must ask for a [JASMIN portal account](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4435-get-a-jasmin-account). If granted, one can then register for a [jasmin-login account] (https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/161-get-login-account). The type of account given will depend on need and priviledges requested. Users granted jasmin-login access get a HOME directory of 100GB of storage and can access the shared JASMIN servers (Scientific servers, data transfer servers, and the LOTUS HPC cluster).\\n   \\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 6}}, {'id': 1753903968084902, 'score': 0.62365735, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='spatial'></a>\\n# Analysis of spatial data\\n\\nSo far in this class, we have mostly considered the analysis of data-series from single locations, where some property is measured repeadedly in time, or data that came already gridded in easy to use format. \\n\\nHowever, often in environmental sciences, we are faced with a different or additional problem; that is one will have to either make sense of many single measurements dispersed in space or even with multiple time-series dispersed in space. \\n\\nThe problem of making sense of spatially dispersed data is often linked to the problem of `contouring`. Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}]",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\\n\\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \\n\\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\\n\\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\\n\\n\\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)). [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu) also manages [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu), one of the first center to have developped climate models and is today one of the gold-standard on the topic. \\n\\nNCAR also developed [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu), an interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization (we will not use NCL here, but the python package `ESMValTool` has build-in support for it). \\n\\n[NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu) has also developped the [climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu), a tool to search and access >200 data sets specific to the ocean, land and the atmosphere.

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753901957112878, 'score': 0.63169223, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_0', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30701Climate data and modelsEDSML MSc –Imperial College London –Environmental dataYves Plancherel-https://www.linkedin.com/in/yves-plancherel/\\nWhy discuss climate data and climate models?\\n1.

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}]",

    "response": "To simulate temperature changes in a study area, you can leverage environmental modeling tools and Python libraries designed for spatial data analysis. Here's a structured approach:\n\n\n1. **Spatial Data Analysis**  \n   - **Interpolation**: Tools like **scipy.interpolate** (e.g., `griddata`, `KDTree`) or **Geopandas** (via `rasterio` or `pyproj`) help estimate values at unsampled locations.  \n   - **Fitting**: Methods like **surface fitting** (e.g., `scipy.optimize.curve_fit`) or **regression** can model trends in scattered data.  \n\n2. **Python Libraries**  \n   - **`scipy`**: For interpolation (e.g., `griddata`, `interpolate`).  \n   - **`geopandas`**: Combines `pandas` and `shapely` for spatial analysis (e.g., `rasterio` for grid data).  \n   - **`matplotlib`**: For visualizing interpolated/fit data.  \n   - **`pyproj`/`PROJ`**: For coordinate systems (CRS) and geospatial transformations.  \n\n3. **Challenges**  \n   - **Discontinuities**: Algorithms (e.g., `griddata`) may struggle with abrupt changes (e.g., mountains).  \n   - **Coordinate Systems**: Ensure data is in a consistent CRS (e.g., WGS84) to avoid misalignment.  \n   - **Model Limitations**: Models are inherently incomplete; results reflect assumptions about data and processes.  \n\n\n1. **Data Preparation**  \n   - Use gridded data (e.g., from NOAA or NASA) for the study area.  \n   - Align coordinates with a consistent CRS (e.g., `pyproj` for `rasterio`).  \n\n2. **Interpolation**  \n   - Apply `scipy.interpolate.griddata` to estimate values at unsampled points.  \n   - Example:  \n     ```python\n     from scipy.interpolate import griddata\n     points = [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...]  # Sample points\n     values = [T1, T2, ...]  # Corresponding temperatures\n     interp_values = griddata(points, values, (x, y), method='linear')\n     ```\n\n3. **Fitting and Modeling**  \n   - Fit a trend (e.g., polynomial) to scattered data using `scipy.optimize.curve_fit`.  \n   - Example:  \n     ```python\n     from scipy.optimize import curve_fit\n     def model(x, a, b):\n         return a * x + b\n     popt, pcov = curve_fit(model, xdata, ydata)\n     ```\n\n4. **Visualization**  \n   - Use `matplotlib` to plot interpolated/fit data against original grid.  \n   - Highlight discontinuities (e.g., using `matplotlib.pyplot.imshow",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \\n\\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe (\\'18\\' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \\n\\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that\\'s a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \\n\\nAlthough UKCP18 is \\'just\\' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\\n\\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\\n\\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn\\'t contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \\n\\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\\n\\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \\n\\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\\n\\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \\nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \\n\\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \\n\\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \\n\\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \\n\\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\\n3. Output: Data only\\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\\n   \\nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \\n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \\n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \\n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \\n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can\\'t differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \\n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that\\'s a lot of data!).\\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \\n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \\n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \\n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don\\'t close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \\n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \\n\\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\\n\\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \\n\\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we\\'ll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\\n\\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 46}}, {'id': 1753903424509295, 'score': 0.6349663, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 01- Introduction to climate data and climate models\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n## Contents\\n- [Lectures](#lectures)\\n- [Question](#question)\\n- [ESMValTool](#ESMValTool)\\n- [Sources of climate data](#climatedata)\\n- [CEDA](#CEDA)\\n- [File formats](#fileformat)\\n- [Metadata](#metadata)\\n- [NetCDF](#NetCDF)\\n- [NCO](#NCO)\\n- [Reanalysis products](#reanalysis)\\n- [Climate services UKCP18](#ukcp18)\\n  \\n## Learning outcomes\\n1.

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902299806645, 'score': 0.6151669, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_2', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' problem under study, etc.\\nWhat does a model need?A very simple numerical exampledCdt=λCCi+1−Citi+1−ti=λCiCi+1=Ci1+λΔt()dCdt=limΔt→0C(t+Δt)−C(t)ΔtRequires discretization of derivativesand numerical integration to step forward from tito tf=NDTForward difference(aka Forward Euler)[climatemodelsusemuchmorecomplex schemes]\\nii+1\\nWhat does a model need?Discretization needed to implement numericallydCdt=λCCi+1−CiΔt=λCi+1Ci+1=λΔtCi+1+CiCi+1=Ci11−λΔtBackward difference(aka backward Euler)Requires solving', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 2}}, {'id': 1753901956917450, 'score': 0.6096754, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_3', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' technology options)\\n\\nUsing climate models: variability(temporal, spatial)\\nImportance of experimental design!Control+ experiment\\nUsing climate models: uncertainties and sensitivities\\nMIP = Model Intercomparison Project\\nEyring et al. 2016\\nUsing climate models: uncertainties and sensitivities\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_ensembleDifferent experimentswith many ensembles!Each one trying to account for sensitivity due to a source of error Real world data: we only have one Earth, ONE realizat', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf', 'chunk_number': 3}}, {'id': 1753901956781118, 'score': 0.6088262, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_5', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'umans•Infrastructures•Agriculture•Biodiversity•Landscape•GDP•Administration•Policy•…\\nThe business (and opportunities) of climate\\nhttps://www.metoffice.gov.uk\\nhttps://cervest.earth\\nhttps://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/campaigns/esg-analysis\\nhttps://www.ukclimaterisk.org\\nhttps://www.ibm.com/uk-en/products/environmental-intelligence-suitehttps://www.rms.com/climate-change\\nBusiness riskand climate analyticshttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00984-6… an emerging field!

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902300429530, 'score': 0.6295367, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_6', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ce scales of interest–Integration time step–Spatial resolution of the grid–Duration of model run–Decisions about time/space scales also translate into “filtering” the equations •(parts of the equations can be neglected and the equations simplified –some physics can be neglected/simplified)\\nWhy model climate?\\n\\nWeather and climate –bridging the gap\\n\\n\\nWhat are coupledclimatemodels?\\n\\nA few key major coupling mechanisms between the ocean and the atmosphere\\nThe “coupler” is the heart of climate models', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 6}}, {'id': 1753902702662417, 'score': 0.6281086, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_10', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ls that are ‘fitted’ to data•Some model parameters are tuned to fit–Question is what to fit/how?

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424804905, 'score': 0.64332294, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_42_code', 'type': 'code', 'content': \"#!/usr/bin/env python\\nimport cdsapi\\n \\nc = cdsapi.Client()\\n \\nc.retrieve(\\n    'reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels',\\n    {\\n        'product_type': 'reanalysis',\\n        'variable': 'temperature',\\n        'pressure_level': '1000',\\n        'year': '2021',\\n        'month': '01',\\n        'day': '01',\\n        'time': '12:00',\\n        'format': 'netcdf',                         # NetCDF\\n        'area'          : [60., -11., 34., 35.],    # Default area is global; provide [North, West, South, East] limits to select an area (here selecting Europe)\\n        'grid'          : [1.0, 1.0],               #  Default atmospheric resolution is 0.25 x 0.25; provie [Latitude/longitude] grid resolution to interpolate data to something else.           \\n    },\\n    'output/ERAtest_subarea_1deg1deg.nc')           # Output file.

The answer will depend on any additional constraints that one applies on these weights and on any additional properties one wishes the field $F$ or $D$ to have (stationarity of various moments, isotropy, etc.). Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}]",

It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424269054, 'score': 0.6688866, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_41_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': 'One can also modify the CDS API download script using optional post-processing arguments.\\n\\nFor example, one can use the `grid` option to change the grid on which the data are presented.  \\n\\nThe native grid of ERA data on CDS is 0.25°x0.25° (atmosphere), 0.5°x0.5° (ocean waves) for variables, while derived quantities, such as mean and variance are on a 0.5°x0.5° (atmosphere) and a coarser 1°x1° (ocean waves).

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903968752811, 'score': 0.6228303, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_21_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='fitting'></a>\\n# Surface fitting\\n\\nThe interpolation techniques described above work very well when the space is relatively well-sampled, when one does not want to extrapolate beyond the convex hull and in the absence of variability or uncertainties associated the control points. If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\\n\\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \\n\\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement. The contoured estimate will tend to either over or underestimate the true value, within a tolerance controlled by the noise associated with the measurements. \\n\\nThe shape of the fitted surface will depend strongly on the data available: their locations, their uncertainties, as well as subjective choices made during the analysis (i.e. definition of the so-called 'covariance matrix').\\n\\nWe will here look at a technique called **kriging**, pioneered by a South African mining engineer called Danie G.

Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\\n\\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \\n\\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\\\left(1-exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-h}{ra}\\\\right)\\\\right)+n_{(0,\\\\infty)}\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\n    \\n2.

It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$. At this point, one can either compute the **spatial covariance**\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nC(k \\\\Delta h)=\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k\\\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nfrom which we can compute the **correlogram**, which is simply the spatial covariance normalized by the data variance (at $k=0$) so as to limit its range to $\\\\pm 1$,\\n\\n\\\\label{eq:corelogram}\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\rho(k \\\\Delta  h)=\\\\frac{C(k \\\\Delta h)}{C(0)}=\\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k \\\\Delta  h)d(x_i)}{\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^m(d(x_i)^2)}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nor look at the mean squared difference and form the **semivariogram**\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\gamma(k \\\\Delta  h)=\\\\frac{1}{2m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^m\\\\left(d(x_i+k\\\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\\\right)^2.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nThe functional forms $C(h)$, $\\\\rho(h)$ or $\\\\gamma(h)$ of these binned, discrete estimates is obtained simply by plotting $C(k\\\\Delta h)$, $\\\\rho(k\\\\Delta  h)$ or $\\\\gamma(k\\\\Delta  h)$ as a function of $k\\\\Delta h$ and by fitting a polynomial throught the results that ensures strictly positive values of $C(h)$, $\\\\rho(h)$ or $\\\\gamma(h)$ for any $h$.\\n\\nNote that the corelogram in geostatistics is very similar to the autocorrelation function used in time-series analysis.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753902300429530, 'score': 0.6654193, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_6', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ce scales of interest–Integration time step–Spatial resolution of the grid–Duration of model run–Decisions about time/space scales also translate into “filtering” the equations •(parts of the equations can be neglected and the equations simplified –some physics can be neglected/simplified)\\nWhy model climate?\\n\\nWeather and climate –bridging the gap\\n\\n\\nWhat are coupledclimatemodels?\\n\\nA few key major coupling mechanisms between the ocean and the atmosphere\\nThe “coupler” is the heart of climate models', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 6}}, {'id': 1753903424509295, 'score': 0.65934384, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 01- Introduction to climate data and climate models\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n## Contents\\n- [Lectures](#lectures)\\n- [Question](#question)\\n- [ESMValTool](#ESMValTool)\\n- [Sources of climate data](#climatedata)\\n- [CEDA](#CEDA)\\n- [File formats](#fileformat)\\n- [Metadata](#metadata)\\n- [NetCDF](#NetCDF)\\n- [NCO](#NCO)\\n- [Reanalysis products](#reanalysis)\\n- [Climate services UKCP18](#ukcp18)\\n  \\n## Learning outcomes\\n1.

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close.

    "response": "The provided text snippets cover key concepts in **climate modeling** and **time series analysis**, emphasizing the challenges and methodologies involved in understanding and interpreting complex systems. Below is a structured summary of the main ideas:\n\n\n- **Model Complexity**: \n  - Models require **discretization** (e.g., grid cells, time steps) to solve differential equations (e.g., Navier-Stokes, energy balance). \n  - **Numerical schemes** (e.g., forward Euler, backward Euler) are used, with forward Euler being simpler but less accurate for dynamic systems.\n  - **Parameterizations** (e.g., subgrid-scale processes) are critical for resolving phenomena like cloud formation, but their accuracy impacts model performance.\n\n- **Uncertainties**:\n  - **Model limitations**: Models may not capture all physical processes (e.g., microphysics, boundary conditions), leading to errors in predictions.\n  - **Data vs. model**: Interpreting model outputs requires understanding **how well they align with observational data** (e.g., spatial/temporal resolution, parameterizations).\n  - **Skill of analysts**: Balancing model complexity with interpretability is crucial, as models may \"overfit\" or \"underfit\" data.\n\n- **Key Challenges**:\n  - **Stationarity**: Models may produce **stationary** (e.g., random walk) or **non-stationary** (e.g., seasonal cycles) data, requiring detrending or spectral analysis.\n  - **Error sources**: \n    - **Numerics**: Discretization errors, stability issues (e.g., stiff equations).\n    - **Parameterizations**: Incomplete representation of processes (e.g., rain events, ocean currents).\n    - **Boundary conditions**: Assumptions about external forcings (e.g., greenhouse gas concentrations) may limit accuracy.\n\n\n- **Synthetic Data**:\n  - Examples include **random walks** (uncorrelated increments) and **seasonal cycles** (non-stationary data).\n  - Techniques like **stationarity testing** (e.g., ACF, PACF) and **detrending** (e.g., moving averages, differencing) are used to remove trends or seasonality.\n\n- **Modeling Approaches**:\n  - **Forward Euler**: Simplest scheme but may struggle with stiff systems.\n  - **Backward Euler**: More stable for dynamic systems but requires solving nonlinear equations.\n  - **Stationarity**: Models may fail to capture long-term trends, requiring adjustments (e.g., detrending or using ARIMA models).\n\n- **Practical Applications**:\n  - **Practicing with stationarity**: Analyzing synthetic data to understand how models handle **non-stationary** signals.\n  - **Interpretation**: Balancing model complexity with interpretability, ensuring outputs align with observational data.\n\n\n- **Climate Modeling**: Requires balancing **model accuracy** with **computational feasibility**, while accounting for **numerical errors**, **parameterization gaps**, and **external uncertainties**.\n- **Time Series Analysis**: Focuses on **stationarity**, **detrending**, and **numerical stability** to extract meaningful patterns from data.\n- **Interdisciplinary Challenge**: Understanding models and data is critical, as models may not fully capture real-world complexities (e.g., microphysics, boundary conditions).\n\nThis synthesis highlights the interplay between **model design",

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753901956917450, 'score': 0.6070507, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_3', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' technology options)\\n\\nUsing climate models: variability(temporal, spatial)\\nImportance of experimental design!Control+ experiment\\nUsing climate models: uncertainties and sensitivities\\nMIP = Model Intercomparison Project\\nEyring et al. 2016\\nUsing climate models: uncertainties and sensitivities\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_ensembleDifferent experimentswith many ensembles!Each one trying to account for sensitivity due to a source of error Real world data: we only have one Earth, ONE realizat', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf', 'chunk_number': 3}}]",

The big question is what values should the weight corresponding to each sample have? Answering this question is not easy - it is basically the whole point of kriging. The answer will depend on any additional constraints that one applies on these weights and on any additional properties one wishes the field $F$ or $D$ to have (stationarity of various moments, isotropy, etc.). Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}, {'id': 1753907767966467, 'score': 0.6051878, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_timeseriesanalysis-IC-X9CYXD36RX.ipynb_cell_30_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='ARMA'></a>\\n### ARMA(p,q) (Auto Regressive Moving Average Models)\\n\\n[ARMA models are a combination of AR and MA models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive–moving-average_model). The AR part involves regressing the variable on its own lagged (i.e., past) values. The MA part involves modeling the error term as a linear combination of error terms occurring contemporaneously and at various times in the past.

    "response": "The Moving Average (MA) model is a fundamental component of time series analysis, particularly in the context of ARIMA models. Here's a structured breakdown of its key aspects:\n\n\n- **MA(q)** models use **past errors** (εₜ₋₁, εₜ₋₂, ..., εₜ₋q) to predict future values.  \n- The model is defined as:  \n  $$\n  X_t = \\mu + \\epsilon_t + \\theta_1 \\epsilon_{t-1} + \\theta_2 \\epsilon_{t-2} + \\cdots + \\theta_q \\epsilon_{t-q}\n  $$  \n  - **μ**: The mean of the time series (ideally 0 for detrended data).  \n  - **θᵢ**: Coefficients (parameters) that weight past errors.  \n  - **εₜ**: White noise errors (independent, uncorrelated, and normally distributed).\n\n\n- **Order (q)**: The number of past errors considered. A higher q implies more historical dependence.  \n- **Short Memory**: MA models are \"short memory\" because the influence of past errors diminishes over time. For example, in MA(1), the error from two steps ago does not affect the prediction of the current value.  \n- **No Autocorrelation**: The errors εₜ are uncorrelated, ensuring the model's stability.\n\n\n- **MA(1)**:  \n  $$\n  X_t = \\mu + \\epsilon_t + \\theta_1 \\epsilon_{t-1}\n  $$  \n  The term [θ₁ε_{t-1}] captures the impact of the previous error. Future predictions are weighted by the historical errors, but the influence of older errors fades over time.\n\n- **Generalization**:  \n  The term in brackets (θ₁^{t-1}ε₂ + ... + ε_t) represents a **moving average** that aggregates all short-term errors. This highlights the connection between MA and AR models, leading to **ARMA** (Autoregressive Moving Average) models.\n\n\n- **Sensitivity to q**:  \n  - Too low q: Misses important temporal dependencies.  \n  - Too high q: Overfits (captures noise instead of signal).  \n- **Stationarity**: MA models are typically stationary if the mean μ is constant.  \n- **Non-Stationarity**: If μ is not constant, the model may need to be adjusted (e.g., differencing).\n\n\n- **Forecasting**: MA models are useful for capturing **persistent errors",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

The signal can be additive, with trends, periods, and errors, e.g. $X_t=T_t+S_t+E_t$, or multiplicative, e.g. $X_t=T_t \\\\cdot S_t \\\\cdot E_t$, where the amplitude of variations of the data could be changing through time. \\n\\nThere are many types of models for time series data, each of which can take various forms and represent different stochastic processes. However, three broad classes are very common and of practical importance: \\n1.  the autoregressive (AR) models, \\n2.  the integrated (I) models, and \\n3.  the moving average (MA) models. \\n   \\nThese three types of models all depend linearly on previous data points (other classes of models exist), and use that information to make a forecast into the future.

Another useful application is to simulate the behaviour of observed random processes (e.g. to use as input to other models, or propagate errors).\\n\\nCombinations of ideas underlying the AR and MA models produce  **autoregressive moving average ([ARMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive–moving-average_model)) models**, while combination of all three types yields the **autoregressive integrated moving average ([ARIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average)) models** .
