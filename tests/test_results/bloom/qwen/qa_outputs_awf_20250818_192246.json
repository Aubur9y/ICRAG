    "response": "Discretization refers to the process of converting continuous mathematical equations into discrete steps for numerical computation. In climate models, it involves choosing parameters like grid spacing (Dx, Dy, Dz), time steps (Dt), and stencil sizes to approximate derivatives (e.g., forward/backward differences). This enables the simulation of dynamical systems, such as atmospheric and oceanic processes, by transforming partial differential equations into solvable forms. (Context 2, Context 3) Its role is critical for balancing computational feasibility with accuracy, as improper discretization can lead to instability or inaccurate results. (Context 2, Context 3)",
