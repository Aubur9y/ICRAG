If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753902300206271, 'score': 0.6651106, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_0', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'Climate models –what are they?\\n…and different grids for different parts of the model:atmosphere, ocean, land, ice,…\\n\\nA bit of review: What do we need to make a model?(Any model, not necessarily a climate one)\\nWhat does a model need?A very simple analytical exampledCdt=λRequires equations (hypotheses about underlying physics)\\nWhat does a model need?A very simple analytical exampledCdt=λdCCoCf∫=λdttotf∫Cf=λtf−to()−CoRequires initial &boundary conditionsRequires equations (hypotheses about underlyi', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 0}}, {'id': 1753903424448348, 'score': 0.65988237, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_46_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '<a id=\\'ukcp18\\'></a>\\n# Towards Climate Services\\n\\n\\n* ## UKCP18: latest high resolution model output for the UK\\n[UKCP](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index) stands for UK Climate Projections. UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \\n\\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe (\\'18\\' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \\n\\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that\\'s a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \\n\\nAlthough UKCP18 is \\'just\\' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\\n\\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\\n\\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn\\'t contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \\n\\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\\n\\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \\n\\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\\n\\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \\nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \\n\\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \\n\\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \\n\\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \\n\\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\\n3. Output: Data only\\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\\n   \\nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \\n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \\n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \\n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \\n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can\\'t differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \\n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that\\'s a lot of data!).\\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \\n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \\n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \\n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don\\'t close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \\n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \\n\\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\\n\\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \\n\\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we\\'ll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\\n\\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 46}}, {'id': 1753902703503123, 'score': 0.6562544, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_1', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'model cannot model the effect of “Z” on climate as “W” has or may have an (unquantified) effect of the “Z” and may effectCO2or T, etc. … therefore climate models are useless\\nSome better propositions1.All models are “wrong” and “incomplete”(modeling with the sole goal of fitting data can be futile)(state-or-the-art models have many free parameters, uniqueness of the fit/solution is not always guaranteed –fit for wrong reason possible)2.Models have the merit of being internally consistent and poss', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf', 'chunk_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753901957112878, 'score': 0.6550982, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_0', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30701Climate data and modelsEDSML MSc –Imperial College London –Environmental dataYves Plancherel-https://www.linkedin.com/in/yves-plancherel/\\nWhy discuss climate data and climate models?\\n1.

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\\n\\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \\n\\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\\n\\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\\n\\n\\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)). [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu) also manages [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu), one of the first center to have developped climate models and is today one of the gold-standard on the topic. \\n\\nNCAR also developed [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu), an interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization (we will not use NCL here, but the python package `ESMValTool` has build-in support for it). \\n\\n[NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu) has also developped the [climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu), a tool to search and access >200 data sets specific to the ocean, land and the atmosphere.

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753902703274403, 'score': 0.65071636, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_4', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'solving dynamical equations–Smaller discretization steps•Better representation of topography/bathymetry (mountains, islands, seamounts…)–Grid-boxes have vertical walls (depends on coordinate system)•Explicit inclusion of subgrid-scale processes–Parameterizing vs. resolving (e.g.eddies, overflows, etc)•Property gradients can be larger –Affects pressure gradients (i.e.velocity of currents)–Model becomes more advective and less diffusive, maybe more turbulent–Exchange-processes that depend on gradi', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf', 'chunk_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753901956993712, 'score': 0.64960873, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_4', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ionModel data: we do what the @#$ we want J!•…as long aswe can calculate it and analyze it•… and are aware of model flaws!\\nUsing climate models: attributionhttps://www.worldweatherattribution.org\\nhttps://www.swissre.com/media/news-releases/nr-20191219-global-catastrophes-estimate.htmlWhose faultis it?Who pays for it?Catastrophe-related insured losses (1970-2019)\\n\\nClimate extremes and climate risk•Magnitude•Frequency•Duration•Spatial extent•Whatvariable?–T, Precipitation, winds, sea level, etc.•H', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf', 'chunk_number': 4}}]",

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753901956989969, 'score': 0.6557145, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_2', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g.calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).Learning objectives of the Environmental Data module•Growing/important field –with likely career opportunities•Great playground to deliver learning objectives\\nUsing climate models: quantification/forecasting(impacts, adaptation, mitigation)\\nhttps://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts\\nUsing climate models: designscenarios(explore policy,', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf', 'chunk_number': 2}}, {'id': 1753902702662417, 'score': 0.65525466, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_10', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ls that are ‘fitted’ to data•Some model parameters are tuned to fit–Question is what to fit/how?

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753902300189238, 'score': 0.6322721, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_7', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': '\\n\\n\\nInterconnecting reservoirs with their own time-scales106 s=11 days105 s=1.5 days107 s=4 months1010 s= 300 years\\nWhy coupling the models in the first place?Teleconnectionsand nonlinear feedbacks\\nWhat is model “coupling”?•Exchanges of properties at the interfaces:–Heat–Water–Momentum–Energy•Modules are run quite independently, but regularly exchange information about each other’s states to calculate exchange fluxes•Challenges:–Grids of various modules may not match•E.g.part of an atmospheric gr', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 7}}, {'id': 1753903424357433, 'score': 0.6285188, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_5_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='climatedata'></a>\\n\\n# Working with climate data and climate models\\n\\n### Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)\\n\\n![esgf](img/ESGF_logo.png)\\n\\n\\n[ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov) is an open-source platform that provides distributed access to peta/exa-scale scientific data, **globally**. \\n\\nIt is an interagency and international effort led by the US Department of Energy (DOE), co-funded by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the US National Science Foundation (NSF), and other international partners, such as the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) German Climate Computing Centre (DKRZ), the Australian National University (ANU) National Computational Infrastructure (NCI), Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), and the **Centre for Environmental Data Analysis ([CEDA](https://www.ceda.ac.uk))** in the UK.\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 5}}]"

    "response": "The provided text discusses key aspects of climate modeling, data handling, and tools for climate research. Here's a structured summary of the main points:\n\n- **Model \"Rightness\":** Models are inherently incomplete, and \"right\" results are rare. They are used to understand past and present climate patterns but cannot reliably predict the future due to uncertainties.\n- **Data Assimilation:** Techniques like **4DVAR** (four-dimensional variational analysis) and **data assimilation** are used to tune model parameters to fit observed data. However, this can lead to overfitting, and models remain \"model results\" rather than accurate representations of reality.\n- **Challenges:** Balancing model accuracy with computational feasibility, and ensuring models reflect real-world complexities.\n\n- **ESMValTool:** A community-driven tool for evaluating climate models. It compares model outputs with observations to quantify biases and assess model performance. It supports HPC systems and integrates with platforms like ESGF.\n- **Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF):** A global, open-access platform for distributed scientific data. It enables researchers to access peta/exa-scale data from various sources, including models and observations. Key partners include DOE, NASA, NOAA, and institutions like CEDA (Centre for Environmental Data Analysis).\n\n- **Climate Services:** The field is evolving toward professionalized climate services, focusing on operational applications like extreme weather prediction, risk assessment, and insurance calculations.\n- **Data Use:** Climate data is critical for attribution studies (e.g., linking climate change to extreme events), impact assessments, and policy planning. Tools like ESMValTool help analyze large datasets, but installation and maintenance (e.g., ESMValTool) can be complex.\n\n- **Model Complexity:** Models must balance computational efficiency with accuracy, often requiring trade-offs between resolution and data availability.\n- **Data Access:** Tools like ESGF are essential for accessing global datasets, but their use requires technical expertise and infrastructure (e.g., HPC resources).\n- **Ethical and Practical Challenges:** Managing data quality, ensuring reproducibility, and addressing the \"cost\" of climate research (e.g., insurance losses) are critical for advancing the field.\n\nThe text highlights the interplay between model limitations, data assimilation techniques, and the infrastructure (like ESGF and ESMValTool) needed to analyze climate data. Researchers must navigate the balance between model accuracy, computational resources, and the practical challenges of applying climate science to real-world problems. Tools like ESMValTool are vital for evaluating model performance,",
