The big question is what values should the weight corresponding to each sample have? Answering this question is not easy - it is basically the whole point of kriging. The answer will depend on any additional constraints that one applies on these weights and on any additional properties one wishes the field $F$ or $D$ to have (stationarity of various moments, isotropy, etc.). Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}, {'id': 1753907767542531, 'score': 0.56910396, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_timeseriesanalysis-IC-X9CYXD36RX.ipynb_cell_33_code', 'type': 'code', 'content': 'import numpy as np\\n# Initialize the constants\\nN, f, b = 4, 0.7, 0.2\\n# Initialize the transition matrix (the transition matrix will be specific to each problem)\\nQ = np.zeros((N + 1, N + 1))    # create a matrix of zeros, of size N+1 x N+1\\nQ[0,1] = f\\nQ[0,0] = 1 - f\\nQ[-1,-1] = 1 - b\\nQ[-1,-2] = b\\nfor i in range(1,N):\\n    Q[i,i-1] = b\\n    Q[i,i] = 1 - b - f\\n    Q[i,i+1] = f\\n\\n## check the size and make up of the Q matrix    \\nprint(Q.shape)\\nprint(Q)\\n\\n\\n# Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors using Numpy\\'s linear algebra solvers\\n# NB: knowing how to solve this is beyond the scope of this week\\'s material\\nevals, evecs = np.linalg.eig(Q.T)\\npi = evecs[:, np.isclose(evals, 1)] \\nprint(\"the probabilities that the drunken sailor is in any state are:\")\\nprint(pi.T / pi.T.sum())\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_timeseriesanalysis-IC-X9CYXD36RX.ipynb', 'cell_number': 33}}, {'id': 1753905536921595, 'score': 0.56910396, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_timeseriesanalysis.ipynb_cell_32_code', 'type': 'code', 'content': 'import numpy as np\\n# Initialize the constants\\nN, f, b = 4, 0.7, 0.2\\n# Initialize the transition matrix (the transition matrix will be specific to each problem)\\nQ = np.zeros((N + 1, N + 1))    # create a matrix of zeros, of size N+1 x N+1\\nQ[0,1] = f\\nQ[0,0] = 1 - f\\nQ[-1,-1] = 1 - b\\nQ[-1,-2] = b\\nfor i in range(1,N):\\n    Q[i,i-1] = b\\n    Q[i,i] = 1 - b - f\\n    Q[i,i+1] = f\\n\\n## check the size and make up of the Q matrix    \\nprint(Q.shape)\\nprint(Q)\\n\\n\\n# Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors using Numpy\\'s linear algebra solvers\\n# NB: knowing how to solve this is beyond the scope of this week\\'s material\\nevals, evecs = np.linalg.eig(Q.T)\\npi = evecs[:, np.isclose(evals, 1)] \\nprint(\"the probabilities that the drunken sailor is in any state are:\")\\nprint(pi.T / pi.T.sum())\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_timeseriesanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 32}}, {'id': 1753901956989969, 'score': 0.561515, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_2', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g.calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).Learning objectives of the Environmental Data module•Growing/important field –with likely career opportunities•Great playground to deliver learning objectives\\nUsing climate models: quantification/forecasting(impacts, adaptation, mitigation)\\nhttps://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts\\nUsing climate models: designscenarios(explore policy,', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf', 'chunk_number': 2}}, {'id': 1753903968040088, 'score': 0.55823183, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_18_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"Now let's explore how the interpolation depends on the number of sample points.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported).

ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\\n\\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \\n\\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\\n\\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\\n\\n\\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)). [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu) also manages [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu), one of the first center to have developped climate models and is today one of the gold-standard on the topic. \\n\\nNCAR also developed [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu), an interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization (we will not use NCL here, but the python package `ESMValTool` has build-in support for it). \\n\\n[NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu) has also developped the [climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu), a tool to search and access >200 data sets specific to the ocean, land and the atmosphere.

These are particularly useful when a process can take on a finite number of states, with varying probabilities. \\n\\nA system consisting of mutually exclusive states and probabilistic transitions between them is called a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) (after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov).\\n\\nThey are often linked to a technique called [`Markov Chain Monte Carlo`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo), which are a class of algorithms for sampling from a probability distribution. This is very useful for numerical error propagation. By constructing a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution, one can obtain a sample of the desired distribution by recording states from the chain. The [`Metropolis-Hastings algorightm`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis–Hastings_algorithm) is also key to certain non-linear global optimization algorithms, such as [`simulated annealing`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing). \\n\\nOne widely used analogy to explain Markov Chains is the 'drunken sailor' moving between his ship to the local pub (...the sailor being so drunk that he can move forwards, backwards, or not move at all):\\n\\n> [A drunken sailor moves from a tavern to his ship. The distance between the tavern and the ship is N steps. With each intermediate step, the sailor has chance **f** of stepping forward, chance **b** of stepping backward, and chance of **1-f-b** of standing still. Where does the sailor end up at the end of the day?](https://medium.com/pragmatic-programmers/what-shall-we-do-with-a-drunken-sailor-c57d9b61339d)\\n\\n\\nTo illustrate, assume there are 4 steps (N=4) between the ship and the tavern.\\n\\n![drunkensailor](img/drunkensailor.png)\\n\\nIn this case, the system comprising the sailor, the tavern, and the path with steps between the two can be in one of the N+1=5 **states** S[i]: \\n1. the sailor is in the tavern; \\n2. the sailor is 1 step away from the tavern; \\n3. the sailor is halfway from the tavern (i.e. 2 steps from anything); \\n4. the sailor is 1 step away from the ship;  \\n5. the sailor is on the ship. \\n   \\nThe probability of being in each state is **p[i]**, and the sum of all probabilities is 1 (the sailor must be at least somewhere).\\n\\nThere are also the probabilities **q[i,j]** of **moving** from the state S[i] to the state S[j]. For instance, if we were to set q[0,0], this could mean that the sailor **is** (S[i]) in the tavern, and **going** to the tavern (S[j]), so he has not actually gone anywhere in this case, but the quantity q[i,j] let's us represent the probability of each move happeneing. In this case, from the tavern, the sailor cannot go backwards, only forwrads towards the ship, so q[0,0]=1-f (i.e. the probability of staying in the tavern is equal to the probability of *not* moving forward).\\n\\nImagine, we start with the state that the sailor **is** in the tavern, so we can say p[0]=1, and set all other p[i]=0. \\n\\nFrom that starting point, we can now imagine what happens during the next step, i.e. the sailor can either move one step forward (i.e. out of the tavern, i.e. p[0] would decrease and p[1] would increase), or stay in the tavern. Whatever happens, though, the drunken sailor has **no memory** of what he did last time...as he is drunk, so each new move is independent of the last move, in a memoryless fashion. \\n\\nThe fact that moves are memoryless does not mean that probabilities of being a state cannot be calculated between steps though. During the second step, the probability of being in step 2, p[2] will depend on wether the sailor was in p[1] or p[0] after step 1, and this depends on the probabilities of moving (q[i,j], which ultimately depends on probabilities **f** and **b** or moving forward and backwards, and on the probabilities of being somewhere (p[i]). \\n\\nTo calculate the probabilities of the sailor being in any given state at a given time step, we simply need to keep track of all probabilities of getting there (q) from each current state (p), and sum them. \\n\\n$\\np’[i] = sum(p[j] · q[j,i])\\n$\\n\\nFor example, for the mid-way state, N=2, equidistant between the ship and the tavern, the probability of being there, i.e. in the new state p'[2] from any previous state 'p', can be represented by:\\n\\n$\\np'[2] = q[0,2] · p[0] + q[1,2]· p[1] + q[2,2]· p[2] + q[3,2]· p[3] + q[4,2]· p[4]\\n$\\n\\nand given our knowledge of the probabilities, we can simplify this as: \\n\\n$\\np’[2] = 0 · p[0] + f · p[1] + (1-f-b) · p[2] + b · p[3] + 0 · p[4]\\n$\\n\\nWe get get to N=2 by moving from step 1 forward, moving from step 3 backwards, or not moving from step 2. We cannot get to step 2 directly from step 0 or 4 (the tavern or the ship) as this would requires two steps (the sailor can only make one step at a time). \\n\\nWe can apply the same logic and calculate the probablilites of being anywhere. For example, the probability of being in step 1, p'[1] would be: \\n\\n$\\np'[1]=q[0,1] · p[0] + q[1,1]· p[1] + q[2,1]· p[2] + q[3,1]· p[3] + q[4,1]· p[4] \\\\\\\\\\np’[1] = f · p[0] + (1-f-b) · p[1] + b · p[2] + 0 · p[3] + 0 · p[4]  \\n$\\n\\nThe 'ps' and the 'qs' for all cases can be quantified and arranged into matrices **'P'** and **'Q'**, such that $P' = P · Q$. **P** is the state matrix, while **Q** is called the **transition** matrix. In the case of N=4, we see that the matrices P and Q are 5x5, or N+1 x N+1. A Markovian system is one where all we know is the current state and transition probabilities, but we don't know (or keep track) of what the previous states were (they don't affect the transition probabilities).\\n\\n\\nMarkovian systems ultimately become stationary in the sense that the distribution of the probabilities of being in each state converge towards stable distributions. When that happens,  $P = P’ = P’’ = P’’’ = ... = π$, that is the probability matrix that sets the probability of being in each state no longer evolves with each new iteration (i.e. the distribution of the probabilities describing the likelihood of being in each state p[i] doesn't change anymore with more iterations). When that happens, since p'[i]=p, we can write $\\\\pi=P=P'$ and so\\n\\n$\\n\\\\pi = \\\\pi \\\\cdot Q\\n$\\n\\nSince this represents a linear system, one could solve it for $\\\\pi$ and we see that $\\\\pi=eig(Q)$, so the probabilities of being in each state, given many steps through the random walk of the drunk sailor, are given by the eigenvalues of the transition matrix. Deriving this is beyond the scope of this introduction, but explanations can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). \\n\\nHere is a python example, assuming the drunken sailor is slightly more likely to go forward (f=0.7) than backward (b=0.2)...so maybe the sailor is not completely drunk yet. \", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_timeseriesanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 31}}]",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

The answer will depend on any additional constraints that one applies on these weights and on any additional properties one wishes the field $F$ or $D$ to have (stationarity of various moments, isotropy, etc.). Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}, {'id': 1753902299521429, 'score': 0.6328347, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_8', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'id box covers ocean+land+sea-ice–Properties must be conserved–Characteristic time-scales in each module differ affecting the time-step of integration needed\\nModel complexity : need vsgreed and the need for speed\\n\\nModel complexity vsresolutionLate 1960s: UNIVAC 1108 (0.5MB of memory!)\\nSyukuro“Suki” Manabe(Nobel prize physics 2021)\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syukuro_ManabeA master at simplifying problem to their essence\\nCray XC304920 nodes x 12 cores = 118080 CPUsEach node as 64GB memoryThe UK’', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 8}}, {'id': 1753903968040088, 'score': 0.63259304, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_18_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"Now let's explore how the interpolation depends on the number of sample points.

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903968752811, 'score': 0.64807737, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_21_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='fitting'></a>\\n# Surface fitting\\n\\nThe interpolation techniques described above work very well when the space is relatively well-sampled, when one does not want to extrapolate beyond the convex hull and in the absence of variability or uncertainties associated the control points.

The semivariogram, often defined as $\\\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \\n\\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\\\left(1-exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-h}{ra}\\\\right)\\\\right)+n_{(0,\\\\infty)}\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\n    \\n2. Gaussian semivariogram model\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\\\left(1-exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{h^2}{a^2}\\\\right)\\\\right)+n_{(0,\\\\infty)}\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\n  \\n3. Spherical semivariogram model\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\n  \\\\gamma(h) =\\n  \\\\begin{cases}\\n    (s-n)\\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\frac{h}{a}-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left( \\\\frac{h}{a}\\\\right)^3 \\\\right)+n_{(0,\\\\infty)} & \\\\text{for }h\\\\le a,\\\\\\\\\\n    (s-n) & \\\\text{for }h > a.\\n  \\\\end{cases}\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\n\\n\\nIn the functions above, $h$ is distance. $s$ is called the `sill`, the value that $\\\\gamma(h)$ tends to as h goes to $\\\\infty$. $r$ is the `range`, or the distance at which the difference $\\\\gamma(h)-s$ becomes negligible. $n$ is called the `nugget` parameter. It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$. At this point, one can either compute the **spatial covariance**\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nC(k \\\\Delta h)=\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k\\\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nfrom which we can compute the **correlogram**, which is simply the spatial covariance normalized by the data variance (at $k=0$) so as to limit its range to $\\\\pm 1$,\\n\\n\\\\label{eq:corelogram}\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\rho(k \\\\Delta  h)=\\\\frac{C(k \\\\Delta h)}{C(0)}=\\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k \\\\Delta  h)d(x_i)}{\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^m(d(x_i)^2)}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nor look at the mean squared difference and form the **semivariogram**\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\gamma(k \\\\Delta  h)=\\\\frac{1}{2m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^m\\\\left(d(x_i+k\\\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\\\right)^2.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nThe functional forms $C(h)$, $\\\\rho(h)$ or $\\\\gamma(h)$ of these binned, discrete estimates is obtained simply by plotting $C(k\\\\Delta h)$, $\\\\rho(k\\\\Delta  h)$ or $\\\\gamma(k\\\\Delta  h)$ as a function of $k\\\\Delta h$ and by fitting a polynomial throught the results that ensures strictly positive values of $C(h)$, $\\\\rho(h)$ or $\\\\gamma(h)$ for any $h$.\\n\\nNote that the corelogram in geostatistics is very similar to the autocorrelation function used in time-series analysis. Indeed, as the lag-distance increases, both $\\\\rho(h)$ and $C(h)$ decrease, while $\\\\gamma(h)$ increases.\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 24}}, {'id': 1753903424423297, 'score': 0.6040344, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_25_code', 'type': 'code', 'content': '# define the coordinate variables (time, level, lat, lon)\\ntimes = rootgrp.createVariable(\"time\",\"f8\",(\"time\",))\\nlevels = rootgrp.createVariable(\"level\",\"i4\",(\"level\",))\\nlatitudes = rootgrp.createVariable(\"lat\",\"f4\",(\"lat\",))\\nlongitudes = rootgrp.createVariable(\"lon\",\"f4\",(\"lon\",))\\n# new variable \\'temp\\' has 4 dimensions, 2 of which are unlimited (time and level)\\ntemp = rootgrp.createVariable(\"temp\",\"f4\",(\"time\",\"level\",\"lat\",\"lon\",))\\n# we can print a summary of the \\'temp\\' variable\\nprint(temp)\\n\\n# we can also creat a variable inside a group (e.g. in forecasts/model1)\\nftemp = rootgrp.createVariable(\"/forecasts/model1/temp\",\"f4\",(\"time\",\"level\",\"lat\",\"lon\",))\\n# we can also query the status of the group\\nprint(\\'--- model1 ---\\')\\nprint(rootgrp[\"/forecasts/model1\"]) \\n# or the variable in the group directly\\nprint(\\'---model1/temp---\\')\\nprint(rootgrp[\"/forecasts/model1/temp\"])\\n\\n# variables in the Dataset are stored as a python dictionary\\nprint(\\'--- python variable dictionary ---\\')\\nprint(rootgrp.variables)', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 25}}]"
