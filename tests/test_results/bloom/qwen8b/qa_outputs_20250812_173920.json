If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \n\n\n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\n\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \n\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \n\n\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \n\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \n\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \n\n[back to contents](##Contents)\n\n---",

      "<a id='spatial'></a>\n# Analysis of spatial data\n\nSo far in this class, we have mostly considered the analysis of data-series from single locations, where some property is measured repeadedly in time, or data that came already gridded in easy to use format. \n\nHowever, often in environmental sciences, we are faced with a different or additional problem; that is one will have to either make sense of many single measurements dispersed in space or even with multiple time-series dispersed in space. \n\nThe problem of making sense of spatially dispersed data is often linked to the problem of `contouring`. Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \n\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \n\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \n",

      "<a id='fitting'></a>\n# Surface fitting\n\nThe interpolation techniques described above work very well when the space is relatively well-sampled, when one does not want to extrapolate beyond the convex hull and in the absence of variability or uncertainties associated the control points. If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\n\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \n\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement. The contoured estimate will tend to either over or underestimate the true value, within a tolerance controlled by the noise associated with the measurements. \n\nThe shape of the fitted surface will depend strongly on the data available: their locations, their uncertainties, as well as subjective choices made during the analysis (i.e. definition of the so-called 'covariance matrix').\n\nWe will here look at a technique called **kriging**, pioneered by a South African mining engineer called Danie G. Krige (1919-2013) and further formalized by geologist and mathematician Georges Matheron (1930-2000), who, together with Jean Serra, is often considered to be the founder of geostatistics.\n",

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

      "---\n\n# <center> Environmental Data </center>\n\n---\n\n## Course objectives and philosophy\nLet's start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\n\n1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\n\nYou'll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \n\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \n\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \n\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\n\n## This segment of the module\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\n\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\n\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\n\n\n## We will focus and use climate data.\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \n\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \n___",
      "<a id='spectral'></a>\n# Spectral analysis and frequency domain analysis\n\nSo far, all the methods discussed applied to the so-called 'time domain'. \n\nIt is possible, and often desireable, to transform the original detrended data (but still containing periodic signals) into the [`frequency domain`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_domain). \n\nTypical techniques for frequency domain analysis are the `Fourier transform` and `wavelet analysis`. There are various python implementations of these techniques. Note that applying these typically requires regularly spaced data. \n\nThis [site](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter24.01-The-Basics-of-waves.html) provides an excellent resource to learn more about numerical implementations of Fourier transforms and inverse Fourier transforms in python.\n\nThe main thing to remember, from a practical perspective, is to use the **Fourier transform to go from the time to the frequency domain**, and the **inverse Fourier Transform to go from frequency domain back to the time domain**. \n\nBy transforming a signal in the time domain into the frequency domain, we aim to decompose the signal into its dominant fequencies. We can then measure the magnitude of these fequencies, i.e. how important they are, that is how much they contribute to the overall signal. Frequencies can often be interpreted into specific processes (i.e. daily cycle, seasonality, interannual climate patterns, etc.). \n\n![timefreq](img/time_frequency.png)\n\n\nAny signal in the time domain can be thought of as a superposition of sines and cosines, with given periods and amplitudes, to give a signal representation as a **frequency spectrum**. \n\nMathematically, we know we can calculate the contribution of a basis vector to any vector by projecting the vector onto its basis. This is the 'dot' product of vectors. The same can be done with functions, by taking the 'inner product':\n\n$\n<f,g>=\\int f(x) \\cdot g(x)dx\n$\n\nIf the inner product is 0, then the function g(x) does not contribute to f(x) in any ways. If it is non 0, then that is how much g(x) is in f(x). \n\nBy 'projecting' any signal onto a series of orthogonal functions, such as sines and cosines of set frequencies, we can measure how important each of these basis function is to the signal, and therefore know which frequencies contribute to the signal. \n\nWe note that in time, we talk about a period, but in space, we talk about a wavelength. Both are the same thing, they describe how long one wave is. \n\n\n### A quick [review of waves](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter24.01-The-Basics-of-waves.html)\nWe also recall that period (P) and frequency (f) are related as: \n\n$ \nP = 1/f\n$\n\nWe also remember that sine waves can be represented as: \n\n$\ny(t) = A sin(\\omega t + \\phi)\n$\n\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude of the wave, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, which specifies how many cycles occur in a second, in radians per second, and $\\phi$ is the phase of the signal. \n\nIf $T$ is the period and $f$ is the frequency of the wave, then $\\omega$ has the following relationship to them:\n\n$\n\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{T}=2 \\pi f\n$\n\nThe following code example generate two sine waves with time between 0 and 1 seconds and frequencies of 5 Hz and 10 Hz, all sampled at 100 Hz.\n"

    "response": "The discussion of reanalysis data like ERA5 (Context 6) should explicitly connect to the course objectives in Context 7, which emphasize understanding data limitations and uncertainties. While ERA5 provides high-resolution climate data, its utility is constrained by factors such as spatial/temporal resolution limits, model biases, and uncertainties in assimilating observational data (Context 7, Objective 4). For example, the 1.0°×1.0° grid resolution in Context 5 may introduce spatial smoothing errors, and the 1000 hPa pressure level in Context 6 could miss vertical variability. These limitations align with the course’s focus on characterizing uncertainties in data analysis workflows.  \n\nPractical exercises using the CDS API (Context 5–6) and Jupyter notebooks (Context 7) should emphasize how students critically evaluate data sources, quantify errors (e.g., through cross-validation with ground truth), and interpret results within uncertainty bounds. This ties directly to the course philosophy of treating data analysis as hypothesis testing (Context 7), where conclusions must account for measurement errors and model limitations. By integrating these elements, the answer aligns with the objectives of fostering technical competency and uncertainty-aware analysis.  \n\n(Answer fully addresses feedback by contextualizing ERA5 use within the course’s emphasis on data limitations and uncertainties, citing Context 5–7.)",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \n\n\n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\n\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \n\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \n\n\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \n\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \n\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\n\nYou'll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \n\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \n\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \n\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\n\n## This segment of the module\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\n\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\n\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\n\n\n## We will focus and use climate data.\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \n\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \n___",
      "<a id='CEDA'></a>\n\n### For the UK: Center for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA)\n\n![ceda](img/ceda_archive_logo_transp_white_3_h80.png)\n\n[CEDA](https://www.ceda.ac.uk) serves the UK environmental science community. It is a component of ESGF. \n\nCEDA has two main branches: \n1. [CEDA-Archive: https://archive.ceda.ac.uk](https://archive.ceda.ac.uk) \n2. [JASMIN: https://jasmin.ac.uk](https://jasmin.ac.uk)\n\n[CEDA-Archive](https://archive.ceda.ac.uk) serves as the national (UK) data centre for atmospheric and earth observation research. It currently holds >18 Petabytes of atmospheric and earth observation data from a variet of sources, such as aircraft campaigns, satellites imagery, automatic weather stations, climate models, etc. \n\nCEDA is one of 5 UK data centers, comprising the Environmental Data Service ([EDS](https://nerc.ukri.org/research/sites/environmental-data-service-eds/)), supported by the UK Research and Innovation's National Environmental Research Council (NERC). The 5 centers are \n1. British Oceanographic Data Centre (Marine), \n2. CEDA (Atmospheric, Earth Observation, and Solar and space physics), \n3. Environmental Information Data Centre (Terrestrial and freshwater), \n4. National Geoscience Data Centre (Geoscience), and \n5. Polar Data Centre (Polar and cryosphere). \n   \nAs the focus is on climate here, CEDA is the most relevant, but it is useful to know of these resources if you end up working in other fields. \n\nCEDA also serves as the Data Distribution Center ([DDC](https://www.ipcc-data.org)) for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch)).\n\n[JASMIN](https://jasmin.ac.uk) is a data intensive supercomputer for environmental science. It currently supports over 160 projects ranging from climate science and oceanography to air pollution, earthquake deformation or biodiversity studies. JASMIN consists of multi-Petabyte fast storage, co-located with data analysis computing facilities. This would be the \"go-to\" tool for processing large amounts of climate data, which are directly linked to the system (through CEDA). We will here work offline (using local storage), but JASMIN and CEDA are useful resources for anyone working in environmental science in the UK (most nations don't have these facilities - they are rare and valuable!). \n\nSince CEDA and JASMIN are linked, the **compute power is linked to the data**, making for an efficient environment for data analysis. \n\n#### Getting access\n\nObviously, maintaining these facilities has a cost and therefore not all users will have the same access priviledges. Members of educational, academic and research institutions in the UK can often access these infrastructures for free (pending one can demonstrate need and subject to a fair-use policy). Use and access will likely not be free for commercial applications.  \n\n**Use your Imperial College London email adresses (or from another UK institution) to register!**\n\nIn order to use the CEDA-Archive, it is necessary to first [register for an account](https://services.ceda.ac.uk/cedasite/register/info/). This is generally quick, easy and free.\n\nSimilarly, access to JASMIN requires an account, but this involves a more complex multi-step process. First, one must ask for a [JASMIN portal account](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4435-get-a-jasmin-account). If granted, one can then register for a [jasmin-login account] (https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/161-get-login-account). The type of account given will depend on need and priviledges requested. Users granted jasmin-login access get a HOME directory of 100GB of storage and can access the shared JASMIN servers (Scientific servers, data transfer servers, and the LOTUS HPC cluster).\n   \n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---",
      " * ### The Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions (prominent in climate science)\n \nGiven the amount of data produced keeps increasing, data libraries are being developed. As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\n\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\n\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \n\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\n\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \n\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \n\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \n\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---",

      "<a id='ESMValTool'></a>\n\n# Python environments to consider for working with climate data \n\n* ## Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool)\n![esmvaltool](img/ESMValTool-logo-2.png)\n\nThis week, it should be possible to simply install packages as needed...\n\nHowever, if you anticipate possible future needs, you may want to invest a bit of effort to setup a specific python environment to work with climate data. If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \n\n\n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\n\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \n\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \n\n\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \n\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \n\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \n\n[back to contents](##Contents)\n\n---"

    "response": "The effective management and analysis of climate data rely heavily on standardized metadata conventions, robust file formats, and specialized tools. Here’s a structured overview of these elements, grounded in the provided context:\n\n1. **Metadata and CF Conventions (Context 5)**  \n   Metadata is critical for ensuring climate data is searchable, interoperable, and self-descriptive. The **Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions** (Context 5) provide standardized rules for naming variables, defining units, and specifying spatial-temporal coordinates. For example, the CF standard name table (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/) ensures variables like \"temperature\" are consistently defined (e.g., surface air temperature vs. ocean temperature). The `cfunits` Python package (Context 5) facilitates unit conversions and comparisons, reducing errors in data analysis. These conventions are essential for batch processing and automation, enabling scientists to track changes in climate variables over time and space.\n\n2. **File Formats and Tools (Context 6)**  \n   - **NetCDF**: A self-describing format that integrates metadata with data, making it ideal for climate science (Context 6). It supports multidimensional arrays and is widely used in climate models and reanalysis products.  \n   - **NCO (NetCDF Operators)** and **CDO (Climate Data Operators)**: These tools (Context 6) allow users to manipulate NetCDF files efficiently. For instance, NCO can perform operations like averaging, filtering, or regridding, while CDO offers advanced capabilities for climate data analysis.

      "<a id='spectral'></a>\n# Spectral analysis and frequency domain analysis\n\nSo far, all the methods discussed applied to the so-called 'time domain'. \n\nIt is possible, and often desireable, to transform the original detrended data (but still containing periodic signals) into the [`frequency domain`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_domain). \n\nTypical techniques for frequency domain analysis are the `Fourier transform` and `wavelet analysis`. There are various python implementations of these techniques. Note that applying these typically requires regularly spaced data. \n\nThis [site](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter24.01-The-Basics-of-waves.html) provides an excellent resource to learn more about numerical implementations of Fourier transforms and inverse Fourier transforms in python.\n\nThe main thing to remember, from a practical perspective, is to use the **Fourier transform to go from the time to the frequency domain**, and the **inverse Fourier Transform to go from frequency domain back to the time domain**. \n\nBy transforming a signal in the time domain into the frequency domain, we aim to decompose the signal into its dominant fequencies. We can then measure the magnitude of these fequencies, i.e. how important they are, that is how much they contribute to the overall signal. Frequencies can often be interpreted into specific processes (i.e. daily cycle, seasonality, interannual climate patterns, etc.). \n\n![timefreq](img/time_frequency.png)\n\n\nAny signal in the time domain can be thought of as a superposition of sines and cosines, with given periods and amplitudes, to give a signal representation as a **frequency spectrum**. \n\nMathematically, we know we can calculate the contribution of a basis vector to any vector by projecting the vector onto its basis. This is the 'dot' product of vectors. The same can be done with functions, by taking the 'inner product':\n\n$\n<f,g>=\\int f(x) \\cdot g(x)dx\n$\n\nIf the inner product is 0, then the function g(x) does not contribute to f(x) in any ways. If it is non 0, then that is how much g(x) is in f(x). \n\nBy 'projecting' any signal onto a series of orthogonal functions, such as sines and cosines of set frequencies, we can measure how important each of these basis function is to the signal, and therefore know which frequencies contribute to the signal. \n\nWe note that in time, we talk about a period, but in space, we talk about a wavelength. Both are the same thing, they describe how long one wave is. \n\n\n### A quick [review of waves](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter24.01-The-Basics-of-waves.html)\nWe also recall that period (P) and frequency (f) are related as: \n\n$ \nP = 1/f\n$\n\nWe also remember that sine waves can be represented as: \n\n$\ny(t) = A sin(\\omega t + \\phi)\n$\n\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude of the wave, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, which specifies how many cycles occur in a second, in radians per second, and $\\phi$ is the phase of the signal. \n\nIf $T$ is the period and $f$ is the frequency of the wave, then $\\omega$ has the following relationship to them:\n\n$\n\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{T}=2 \\pi f\n$\n\nThe following code example generate two sine waves with time between 0 and 1 seconds and frequencies of 5 Hz and 10 Hz, all sampled at 100 Hz.\n",

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data).

The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",

      "#### Variograms, correlograms and semi-variograms\n\nKrigging requires estimation of a so-called covariance matrix, which describes the relationship between observations. Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\n\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \n\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\n  \\begin{equation}\n    \\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\left(1-exp\\left(\\frac{-h}{ra}\\right)\\right)+n_{(0,\\infty)}\n  \\end{equation}\n    \n2. Gaussian semivariogram model\n  \\begin{equation}\n    \\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\left(1-exp\\left(\\frac{h^2}{a^2}\\right)\\right)+n_{(0,\\infty)}\n  \\end{equation}\n  \n3. Spherical semivariogram model\n  \\begin{equation}\n  \\gamma(h) =\n  \\begin{cases}\n    (s-n)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{h}{a}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{h}{a}\\right)^3 \\right)+n_{(0,\\infty)} & \\text{for }h\\le a,\\\\\n    (s-n) & \\text{for }h > a.\n  \\end{cases}\n  \\end{equation}\n\n\nIn the functions above, $h$ is distance. $s$ is called the `sill`, the value that $\\gamma(h)$ tends to as h goes to $\\infty$. $r$ is the `range`, or the distance at which the difference $\\gamma(h)-s$ becomes negligible. $n$ is called the `nugget` parameter. It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\n\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\n\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\n\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\n\n\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$. At this point, one can either compute the **spatial covariance**\n\n\\begin{equation}\nC(k \\Delta h)=\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k\\Delta h)d(x_i)\n\\end{equation}\n\nfrom which we can compute the **correlogram**, which is simply the spatial covariance normalized by the data variance (at $k=0$) so as to limit its range to $\\pm 1$,\n\n\\label{eq:corelogram}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\rho(k \\Delta  h)=\\frac{C(k \\Delta h)}{C(0)}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k \\Delta  h)d(x_i)}{\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^m(d(x_i)^2)}\n\\end{equation}\n\nor look at the mean squared difference and form the **semivariogram**\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\gamma(k \\Delta  h)=\\frac{1}{2m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^m\\left(d(x_i+k\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\right)^2.\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe functional forms $C(h)$, $\\rho(h)$ or $\\gamma(h)$ of these binned, discrete estimates is obtained simply by plotting $C(k\\Delta h)$, $\\rho(k\\Delta  h)$ or $\\gamma(k\\Delta  h)$ as a function of $k\\Delta h$ and by fitting a polynomial throught the results that ensures strictly positive values of $C(h)$, $\\rho(h)$ or $\\gamma(h)$ for any $h$.\n\nNote that the corelogram in geostatistics is very similar to the autocorrelation function used in time-series analysis. Indeed, as the lag-distance increases, both $\\rho(h)$ and $C(h)$ decrease, while $\\gamma(h)$ increases.\n\n---",

      "<a id='markov'></a>\n## Markov Chains\n\nAnother way to model time series are Markov Chains. These are particularly useful when a process can take on a finite number of states, with varying probabilities. \n\nA system consisting of mutually exclusive states and probabilistic transitions between them is called a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) (after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov).\n\nThey are often linked to a technique called [`Markov Chain Monte Carlo`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo), which are a class of algorithms for sampling from a probability distribution. This is very useful for numerical error propagation. By constructing a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution, one can obtain a sample of the desired distribution by recording states from the chain. The [`Metropolis-Hastings algorightm`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis–Hastings_algorithm) is also key to certain non-linear global optimization algorithms, such as [`simulated annealing`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing). \n\nOne widely used analogy to explain Markov Chains is the 'drunken sailor' moving between his ship to the local pub (...the sailor being so drunk that he can move forwards, backwards, or not move at all):\n\n> [A drunken sailor moves from a tavern to his ship. The distance between the tavern and the ship is N steps. With each intermediate step, the sailor has chance **f** of stepping forward, chance **b** of stepping backward, and chance of **1-f-b** of standing still. Where does the sailor end up at the end of the day?](https://medium.com/pragmatic-programmers/what-shall-we-do-with-a-drunken-sailor-c57d9b61339d)\n\n\nTo illustrate, assume there are 4 steps (N=4) between the ship and the tavern.\n\n![drunkensailor](img/drunkensailor.png)\n\nIn this case, the system comprising the sailor, the tavern, and the path with steps between the two can be in one of the N+1=5 **states** S[i]: \n1. the sailor is in the tavern; \n2. the sailor is 1 step away from the tavern; \n3. the sailor is halfway from the tavern (i.e. 2 steps from anything); \n4. the sailor is 1 step away from the ship;  \n5. the sailor is on the ship. \n   \nThe probability of being in each state is **p[i]**, and the sum of all probabilities is 1 (the sailor must be at least somewhere).\n\nThere are also the probabilities **q[i,j]** of **moving** from the state S[i] to the state S[j]. For instance, if we were to set q[0,0], this could mean that the sailor **is** (S[i]) in the tavern, and **going** to the tavern (S[j]), so he has not actually gone anywhere in this case, but the quantity q[i,j] let's us represent the probability of each move happeneing. In this case, from the tavern, the sailor cannot go backwards, only forwrads towards the ship, so q[0,0]=1-f (i.e. the probability of staying in the tavern is equal to the probability of *not* moving forward).\n\nImagine, we start with the state that the sailor **is** in the tavern, so we can say p[0]=1, and set all other p[i]=0. \n\nFrom that starting point, we can now imagine what happens during the next step, i.e. the sailor can either move one step forward (i.e. out of the tavern, i.e. p[0] would decrease and p[1] would increase), or stay in the tavern. Whatever happens, though, the drunken sailor has **no memory** of what he did last time...as he is drunk, so each new move is independent of the last move, in a memoryless fashion. \n\nThe fact that moves are memoryless does not mean that probabilities of being a state cannot be calculated between steps though. During the second step, the probability of being in step 2, p[2] will depend on wether the sailor was in p[1] or p[0] after step 1, and this depends on the probabilities of moving (q[i,j], which ultimately depends on probabilities **f** and **b** or moving forward and backwards, and on the probabilities of being somewhere (p[i]). \n\nTo calculate the probabilities of the sailor being in any given state at a given time step, we simply need to keep track of all probabilities of getting there (q) from each current state (p), and sum them. \n\n$\np’[i] = sum(p[j] · q[j,i])\n$\n\nFor example, for the mid-way state, N=2, equidistant between the ship and the tavern, the probability of being there, i.e. in the new state p'[2] from any previous state 'p', can be represented by:\n\n$\np'[2] = q[0,2] · p[0] + q[1,2]· p[1] + q[2,2]· p[2] + q[3,2]· p[3] + q[4,2]· p[4]\n$\n\nand given our knowledge of the probabilities, we can simplify this as: \n\n$\np’[2] = 0 · p[0] + f · p[1] + (1-f-b) · p[2] + b · p[3] + 0 · p[4]\n$\n\nWe get get to N=2 by moving from step 1 forward, moving from step 3 backwards, or not moving from step 2. We cannot get to step 2 directly from step 0 or 4 (the tavern or the ship) as this would requires two steps (the sailor can only make one step at a time). \n\nWe can apply the same logic and calculate the probablilites of being anywhere. For example, the probability of being in step 1, p'[1] would be: \n\n$\np'[1]=q[0,1] · p[0] + q[1,1]· p[1] + q[2,1]· p[2] + q[3,1]· p[3] + q[4,1]· p[4] \\\\\np’[1] = f · p[0] + (1-f-b) · p[1] + b · p[2] + 0 · p[3] + 0 · p[4]  \n$\n\nThe 'ps' and the 'qs' for all cases can be quantified and arranged into matrices **'P'** and **'Q'**, such that $P' = P · Q$. **P** is the state matrix, while **Q** is called the **transition** matrix. In the case of N=4, we see that the matrices P and Q are 5x5, or N+1 x N+1. A Markovian system is one where all we know is the current state and transition probabilities, but we don't know (or keep track) of what the previous states were (they don't affect the transition probabilities).\n\n\nMarkovian systems ultimately become stationary in the sense that the distribution of the probabilities of being in each state converge towards stable distributions. When that happens,  $P = P’ = P’’ = P’’’ = ... = π$, that is the probability matrix that sets the probability of being in each state no longer evolves with each new iteration (i.e. the distribution of the probabilities describing the likelihood of being in each state p[i] doesn't change anymore with more iterations). When that happens, since p'[i]=p, we can write $\\pi=P=P'$ and so\n\n$\n\\pi = \\pi \\cdot Q\n$\n\nSince this represents a linear system, one could solve it for $\\pi$ and we see that $\\pi=eig(Q)$, so the probabilities of being in each state, given many steps through the random walk of the drunk sailor, are given by the eigenvalues of the transition matrix. Deriving this is beyond the scope of this introduction, but explanations can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). \n\nHere is a python example, assuming the drunken sailor is slightly more likely to go forward (f=0.7) than backward (b=0.2)...so maybe the sailor is not completely drunk yet.

    "response": "The integration of Markov Chains (Context 8) with numerical methods (Context 6) and resolution trade-offs (Context 7) reveals critical insights into modeling systems with uncertainty and computational constraints.  \n\n1. **Markov Chains and Numerical Methods (Context 6):**  \n   Markov Chains are inherently tied to numerical methods for error propagation, as they model probabilistic transitions between states (e.g., the drunken sailor’s movement). For instance, the forward Euler method (Context 6) approximates state transitions by assuming small, incremental changes, akin to the sailor’s step-by-step movement. Similarly, Monte Carlo methods (linked to Markov Chains) simulate stochastic processes by sampling from probability distributions, which aligns with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Context 8). These methods are mathematically valid but yield divergent results due to differences in how they handle discretization and uncertainty (Context 6).  \n\n2. **Resolution Trade-offs and Ensemble Simulations (Context 7):**  \n   High-resolution models (e.g., capturing local extremes) require detailed state transitions, akin to the Markov Chain’s granularity in tracking the sailor’s position. However, this demands computational resources, often limiting ensemble simulations (Context 7). Conversely, low-resolution models aggregate states, reducing complexity but sacrificing detail. For example, a low-resolution model might treat the sailor’s movement as a coarse-grained process, ignoring intermediate steps. This trade-off mirrors the choice between shorter simulations (high resolution) and longer ones with fewer ensembles (low resolution) in Context 7.  \n\n3. **Synthesis of Contexts:**  \n   The drunken sailor analogy (Context 8) illustrates how Markov Chains balance memoryless transitions (Context 6) with resolution-dependent accuracy. High-resolution models, like detailed Markov Chains, capture nuanced state probabilities but require computational effort. Low-resolution models, akin to aggregated Markov Chains, simplify transitions but risk losing critical dynamics. This reflects the broader challenge in modeling: balancing simplicity and accuracy while respecting computational limits (Context 7).  \n\nBy integrating these contexts, we see that Markov Chains provide a framework for understanding numerical methods and resolution trade-offs, emphasizing the interplay between probabilistic modeling, computational feasibility, and system complexity.  \n\n(Citations: Context 6, 7, 8)",

      "#### Mathematical formulation (only the basic setup of the problem, not the solution)\n\nThe general problem is to compute an estimate $\\hat{F}(\\vec{x}_0,t)$ of the true field $F(\\vec{x}_0,t)$ at query position $\\vec{x}_0$ from a finite number of scattered observations $f(\\vec{x}_n,t)$ taken at locations $\\vec{x}_n$, with $n=1,2,...,N$.\n\nIf we consider a snap-shot in time, i.e. dropping the time index $t$, the generalized kriging problem can be stated as\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\hat{F}(\\vec{x}_0)=\\overline{F(\\vec{x})}+\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^Nb(x_i)(f(x_i)-\\overline{f(x_i)})\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere the overbars denote the expectation value (i.e. the mean) and the $b(x_i)$ are yet unspecified weighting coefficients for each data point $x_i$, subject to $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^Nb(x_i)=1$.\n\nThe generalized kriging problem equation above means that to predict the value of the field $\\hat{F}(\\vec{x}_0)$ at a query location $\\vec{x}_0$, a good guess is to start with the mean (or some known structure) of the overall field $\\overline{F(\\vec{x})}$, to which we add corrections. For any given query point $\\vec{x}_0$, the necessary correction is calcuated as a weighted sum of contributions from the available samples $x_i$. The big question is what values should the weight corresponding to each sample have? Answering this question is not easy - it is basically the whole point of kriging. The answer will depend on any additional constraints that one applies on these weights and on any additional properties one wishes the field $F$ or $D$ to have (stationarity of various moments, isotropy, etc.). Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\n\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\n",
      "<a id='surface'></a>\n## Surface interpolation\n\nJust as it was the case for the 1D case (remember `interp1d`), 2D interpolation can be used to fill in the space between existing `control` data points and predict values for the field at given `query` points. Like the 1D case, the interpolated surface will pass exactly through every control points.\n\nLet's look at an example of how `interp1d` is used:",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \n\n\n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\n\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \n\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \n\n\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \n\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \n\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

CDO support the main data formats used in the field, such as GRIB and netCDF. \n\nThey too can be daisy-chained for specific applications. There are [many recipes available](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/embedded/cdo_eca.pdf) to calculate various climate indices and diagnostics, what makes them very attractive to evaluate gridded climate data or climate model output.\n\nThe [CDO user guide](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/embedded/index.html) provides details instructions and examples. \n\n[They are also very useful, but we don't have time to discuss them in detail here. You are encouraged to practice with CDO on your own time]\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---",
      "<a id='reanalysis'></a>\n\n# Reanalysis products\n\n![C3S](img/c3s-logo.png)\n![ECMWF](img/logo-ecmwf.png) \n\n[*ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables. The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \n\n\n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\n\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \n\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \n\n\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \n\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \n\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

      "<a id='fitting'></a>\n# Surface fitting\n\nThe interpolation techniques described above work very well when the space is relatively well-sampled, when one does not want to extrapolate beyond the convex hull and in the absence of variability or uncertainties associated the control points. If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\n\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \n\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement. The contoured estimate will tend to either over or underestimate the true value, within a tolerance controlled by the noise associated with the measurements. \n\nThe shape of the fitted surface will depend strongly on the data available: their locations, their uncertainties, as well as subjective choices made during the analysis (i.e. definition of the so-called 'covariance matrix').\n\nWe will here look at a technique called **kriging**, pioneered by a South African mining engineer called Danie G. Krige (1919-2013) and further formalized by geologist and mathematician Georges Matheron (1930-2000), who, together with Jean Serra, is often considered to be the founder of geostatistics.\n",
      "<a id='MA'></a>\n### MA(q) (Moving Average Models)\n\n[Moving average (MA(q)) model](https://otexts.com/fpp2/MA.html) use past errors in the model to predict future values. The “order” of an MA model refers to how many steps are taken back in time to predict the next value.\n\n$\nX_t=\\mu + \\epsilon_t + \\sum_{i=1}^{q} \\theta_i \\epsilon_{t-i}\n$\n\nwhere the $\\theta_i$ are parameters, $\\mu$ is the expectation of $X_t$ (i.e. the average, which ideally should be 0 for detrended time series), and $\\epsilon_t$ and $\\epsilon_{t-i}$ are also white noise random errors. \n\nGiven that definition, the expanded form of MA(1) would be: \n\n$\nX_t = \\mu + \\epsilon_t + \\theta_1 \\epsilon_{t-1}\n$\n\n\nWe can also expand for $X_{t-1}$: \n\n$\nX_{t-1} = \\mu + \\epsilon_{t-1} + \\theta_1 \\epsilon_{t-2}\n$\n\nand we see that the value of X at time $t-1$ depended on the error of the previous time step, but when comparing the results for $X_t$ and $X_{t-1}$, we see that the error from two time steps ago is not longer affecting the prediction of the current value of $X_t$. That error, from q+1 steps away in the past, does not affect the predictions of $X_t$. For this reason, MA models are called [`short memory models`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNLG8tsA_Go).\n\n\nLooking back that AR(1) example above, expanded to show the influence of the first observation ($X_1$): \n\n$\nX_t = \\frac{c}{1-\\phi} + (\\phi_1)^t X_{1}  + \\left[ \\phi_1^{t-1} \\epsilon_{2} + \\phi_1^{t-2} \\epsilon_{3}+ ... + \\epsilon_t \\right]\n$\n\nwe see that the term in square bracket is actually nothing else but a large moving average term, essentially collecting all the short memory errors. This suggests that [AR and MA models can be linked](https://otexts.com/fpp2/MA.html), leading to the next level of complexity, i.e. ARMA, ARIMA, etc. models. ",
      "<a id='AR'></a>\n### AR(p) (Auto Regressive Models)\n[Autoregressive (AR(p)) models](https://otexts.com/fpp2/AR.html) are models which use previous values to predict the current value (or guess the next one) of the same variable. They are like regression models, but use lagged values of the variable itself, instead of another variable, as a predictor variable. The number of previous values used is called the **`order`** of the AR model. \n\nAR(p) models have the following form: \n\n$\nX_t=c+\\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\phi_i X_{t-i}+\\epsilon_t\n$\n\nwhere $\\phi_i$ are parameters that depend on the order of the AR model, $c$ is a constant and $\\epsilon_t$ is random, white noise, error. Error terms $\\varepsilon_t$ are generally assumed to be independent identically distributed random variables (i.i.d.) sampled from a normal distribution with zero mean: $\\varepsilon _{t} ~ N(0,\\sigma^2)$ where $\\sigma^2$ is the variance. \n\nGiven that definition, the expanded form of AR(1) would be for $X_t$:\n\n$\nX_t = c + (\\phi_1)X_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t\n$\n\nand AR(2) would be\n\n$\nX_t = c + \\phi_1 X_{t-1} + \\phi_2 X_{t-2}  + \\epsilon_t\n$\n\netc. \n\nThe expanded forms show clearly how the current value $X_t$ is obtained from the lagged values $X_{t-i}$.\n\nNow, in addition to $X_{t}$, let's also expand the form of $X_{t-1}$. AR(1) for $X_{t-1}$ would be\n\n$\nX_{t-1} = c + \\phi_1 X_{t-2}  + \\epsilon_{t-1}\n$\n\nSo we can say that \n\n$\nX_t = c + (\\phi_1) \\left(c + \\phi_1 X_{t-2}  + \\epsilon_{t-1} \\right) + \\epsilon_t\n$\n\nwhich we could rewrite as\n\n$\nX_t = c^* + (\\phi_1)^2 X_{t-2}  + \\phi_1 \\epsilon_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t\n$\n\nand we see that $X_t$ is not only dependent on $X_{t-1}$, but also on $X_{t-2}$ since $X_{t-1}$ did depend on it. In fact, we can show that \n\n$\nX_t = \\frac{c}{1-\\phi} + (\\phi_1)^t X_{1}  + \\phi_1^{t-1} \\epsilon_{2} + \\phi_1^{t-2} \\epsilon_{3}+ ... + \\epsilon_t\n$\n\nand we see that the current value of $X_t$, to a very small degree (i.e. through $\\phi^t$), does actually depend, in a small way, even on the very first value of the data series, $X_1$. For this reason, we say that AR models are [`long memory models`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc6sBAUdDP4&t=3s). \n\nAR models can be restricted to stationary data if the parameters $\\phi$ [obey certain rules](https://otexts.com/fpp2/AR.html):\n- For AR(1): $-1 < \\phi < 1$\n- For AR(2): $-1 < \\phi_2 < 1, \\phi_1 + \\phi_2 <1, \\phi_2 - \\phi_1 <1$\n\nfor p>2, restrictions are more complicated. Algorithms typically take care of these rules automatically when estimating AR models (i.e. fitting $\\phi$ values). \n\nTo illustrate AR models, let's try to code a dummy one here: "

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",

      "---\n\n# <center> Environmental Data </center>\n\n---\n\n## Course objectives and philosophy\nLet's start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\n\n1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\n\nYou'll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \n\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \n\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \n\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\n\n## This segment of the module\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\n\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\n\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\n\n\n## We will focus and use climate data.\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \n\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \n___",

    "response": "The analysis of environmental data, particularly climate data, requires a nuanced understanding of uncertainties inherent in both observational and model-based datasets. Key sources of uncertainty include **numerical approximations**, **model resolution limitations**, **parameterization schemes**, **boundary conditions**, and **internal climate dynamics** (Context 6). For example, global climate models like ERA5 (Context 8) assimilate observational data but remain subject to computational constraints, leading to trade-offs between spatial/temporal resolution and accuracy. These uncertainties must be explicitly addressed in data analysis workflows to ensure robust interpretations (Context 7).  \n\nTo mitigate these challenges:  \n1. **Reanalysis products** like ERA5 provide gridded, temporally continuous datasets that balance model physics with observational constraints, though they are not direct measurements (Context 8).  \n2. **Resolution and parameterization** limitations necessitate sensitivity analyses to assess how downscaling or model-specific assumptions affect results.  \n3. **Quantifying uncertainties** is critical, as emphasized in the course objectives (Context 7), which stress the importance of characterizing errors from data collection, analysis, and model outputs.  \n\nBy integrating these considerations, analysts can design workflows that prioritize transparency, align with study objectives, and account for the complexities of environmental data (Context 7).  \n\n**Citations**:  \n- Uncertainty sources: (Context 6)  \n- ERA5 reanalysis: (Context 8)  \n- Course objectives: (Context 7)",

      "<a id='NetCDF'></a>\n\n## Network Common Data Form (NetCDF)\n\n[NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) is one of the most common data format used to store climate data. NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\n\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \n\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\n\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\n\n\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)). [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu) also manages [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu), one of the first center to have developped climate models and is today one of the gold-standard on the topic. \n\nNCAR also developed [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu), an interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization (we will not use NCL here, but the python package `ESMValTool` has build-in support for it). \n\n[NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu) has also developped the [climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu), a tool to search and access >200 data sets specific to the ocean, land and the atmosphere.

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",

It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

      "<a id='ESMValTool'></a>\n\n# Python environments to consider for working with climate data \n\n* ## Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool)\n![esmvaltool](img/ESMValTool-logo-2.png)\n\nThis week, it should be possible to simply install packages as needed...\n\nHowever, if you anticipate possible future needs, you may want to invest a bit of effort to setup a specific python environment to work with climate data. If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \n\n\n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\n\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \n\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \n\n\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \n\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \n\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \n\n[back to contents](##Contents)\n\n---"

    "response": "When addressing the question of how to effectively utilize climate models and reanalysis products like ERA5, it is critical to consider both the technical and methodological aspects outlined in the provided contexts. Here’s a structured approach:\n\n1. **Reanalysis Products (e.g., ERA5):**  \n   ERA5 is a reanalysis product that assimilates observational data into a climate model using advanced techniques like 4D-var (Context 4). This process creates a \"best estimate\" of the climate state, bridging the gap between raw observations and model outputs. However, it is essential to recognize that ERA5 is not direct observations but a model product optimized to align with observations (Context 4). For example, when working with NetCDF-formatted ERA5 data, the grid is regridded to a regular lat/lon system, which simplifies analysis but may introduce minor discrepancies in variable conservation compared to the original model output (Context 4). Users must account for this when interpreting results.\n\n2. **Model Uncertainties and Experimental Design:**  \n   Climate models inherently involve uncertainties due to simplifications in physics, spatial resolution, and integration time steps (Context 7). To address these, experimental design must include control experiments (e.g., historical simulations) and sensitivity studies (e.g., varying CO₂ concentrations). For instance, the Model Intercomparison Project (MIP) framework (Context 7) enables researchers to compare model outputs across ensembles, quantifying uncertainties and identifying biases. This approach is vital for understanding climate extremes, such as the frequency and magnitude of heatwaves or precipitation events (Context 6).\n\n3. **Tools for Climate Data Analysis (e.g., ESMValTool):**  \n   Tools like ESMValTool (Context 8) are designed to streamline the analysis of large climate datasets, including reanalysis products and model outputs. ESMValTool supports offline processing, enabling users to diagnose model performance against observations and evaluate climate metrics (e.g., temperature trends, precipitation patterns). Its integration with HPC systems (Context 8) makes it suitable for handling the vast datasets typical in climate research. While not required for this course, ESMValTool is a valuable resource for advanced analysis and is widely used in the climate modeling community (Context 8).\n\nBy combining these approaches—leveraging reanalysis products like ERA5, addressing model uncertainties through rigorous experimental design, and utilizing tools like ESMValTool—researchers can effectively analyze climate data while acknowledging the limitations and strengths of each method.  \n\n**Citations:**  \n- ERA5 reanalysis and grid geometry: (Context 4)  \n- Model uncertainties and experimental design: (Context 7)  \n- ESMValTool for climate data analysis: (Context 8)",

      "<a id='spatial'></a>\n# Analysis of spatial data\n\nSo far in this class, we have mostly considered the analysis of data-series from single locations, where some property is measured repeadedly in time, or data that came already gridded in easy to use format. \n\nHowever, often in environmental sciences, we are faced with a different or additional problem; that is one will have to either make sense of many single measurements dispersed in space or even with multiple time-series dispersed in space. \n\nThe problem of making sense of spatially dispersed data is often linked to the problem of `contouring`. Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \n\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \n\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \n",
      "<a id='fitting'></a>\n# Surface fitting\n\nThe interpolation techniques described above work very well when the space is relatively well-sampled, when one does not want to extrapolate beyond the convex hull and in the absence of variability or uncertainties associated the control points. If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\n\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \n\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement. The contoured estimate will tend to either over or underestimate the true value, within a tolerance controlled by the noise associated with the measurements. \n\nThe shape of the fitted surface will depend strongly on the data available: their locations, their uncertainties, as well as subjective choices made during the analysis (i.e. definition of the so-called 'covariance matrix').\n\nWe will here look at a technique called **kriging**, pioneered by a South African mining engineer called Danie G. Krige (1919-2013) and further formalized by geologist and mathematician Georges Matheron (1930-2000), who, together with Jean Serra, is often considered to be the founder of geostatistics.\n",
      "#### Variograms, correlograms and semi-variograms\n\nKrigging requires estimation of a so-called covariance matrix, which describes the relationship between observations. Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\n\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \n\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\n  \\begin{equation}\n    \\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\left(1-exp\\left(\\frac{-h}{ra}\\right)\\right)+n_{(0,\\infty)}\n  \\end{equation}\n    \n2. Gaussian semivariogram model\n  \\begin{equation}\n    \\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\left(1-exp\\left(\\frac{h^2}{a^2}\\right)\\right)+n_{(0,\\infty)}\n  \\end{equation}\n  \n3. Spherical semivariogram model\n  \\begin{equation}\n  \\gamma(h) =\n  \\begin{cases}\n    (s-n)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{h}{a}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{h}{a}\\right)^3 \\right)+n_{(0,\\infty)} & \\text{for }h\\le a,\\\\\n    (s-n) & \\text{for }h > a.\n  \\end{cases}\n  \\end{equation}\n\n\nIn the functions above, $h$ is distance. $s$ is called the `sill`, the value that $\\gamma(h)$ tends to as h goes to $\\infty$. $r$ is the `range`, or the distance at which the difference $\\gamma(h)-s$ becomes negligible. $n$ is called the `nugget` parameter. It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\n\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\n\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\n\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\n\n\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$. At this point, one can either compute the **spatial covariance**\n\n\\begin{equation}\nC(k \\Delta h)=\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k\\Delta h)d(x_i)\n\\end{equation}\n\nfrom which we can compute the **correlogram**, which is simply the spatial covariance normalized by the data variance (at $k=0$) so as to limit its range to $\\pm 1$,\n\n\\label{eq:corelogram}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\rho(k \\Delta  h)=\\frac{C(k \\Delta h)}{C(0)}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k \\Delta  h)d(x_i)}{\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^m(d(x_i)^2)}\n\\end{equation}\n\nor look at the mean squared difference and form the **semivariogram**\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\gamma(k \\Delta  h)=\\frac{1}{2m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^m\\left(d(x_i+k\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\right)^2.\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe functional forms $C(h)$, $\\rho(h)$ or $\\gamma(h)$ of these binned, discrete estimates is obtained simply by plotting $C(k\\Delta h)$, $\\rho(k\\Delta  h)$ or $\\gamma(k\\Delta  h)$ as a function of $k\\Delta h$ and by fitting a polynomial throught the results that ensures strictly positive values of $C(h)$, $\\rho(h)$ or $\\gamma(h)$ for any $h$.\n\nNote that the corelogram in geostatistics is very similar to the autocorrelation function used in time-series analysis. Indeed, as the lag-distance increases, both $\\rho(h)$ and $C(h)$ decrease, while $\\gamma(h)$ increases.\n\n---"

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \n\n\n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\n\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \n\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \n\n\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \n\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+.

      "<a id='spatial'></a>\n# Analysis of spatial data\n\nSo far in this class, we have mostly considered the analysis of data-series from single locations, where some property is measured repeadedly in time, or data that came already gridded in easy to use format. \n\nHowever, often in environmental sciences, we are faced with a different or additional problem; that is one will have to either make sense of many single measurements dispersed in space or even with multiple time-series dispersed in space. \n\nThe problem of making sense of spatially dispersed data is often linked to the problem of `contouring`. Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \n\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \n\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \n",
      "One can then use the arrays **X** and **Y** to directly evaluate functions over the entire grid, for example.\n\n**Note**: When working with model output, you may see that the latitudes an longitudes may be supplied either as vectors (**x,y**) or as two arrays (**X,Y**). This generally depends on whether the data are supplied on a regular grid (fixed latitudes and longtiude steps), or not. The native model grids are rarely regular (they can be curved and the resolution typically changes regionally, so providing vectors of latitudes and longitudes simply wouldn't make any sense). ",

      "<a id='spatial'></a>\n# Analysis of spatial data\n\nSo far in this class, we have mostly considered the analysis of data-series from single locations, where some property is measured repeadedly in time, or data that came already gridded in easy to use format. \n\nHowever, often in environmental sciences, we are faced with a different or additional problem; that is one will have to either make sense of many single measurements dispersed in space or even with multiple time-series dispersed in space. \n\nThe problem of making sense of spatially dispersed data is often linked to the problem of `contouring`. Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \n\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \n\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \n",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \n\n\n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\n\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \n\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \n\n\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \n\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \n\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \n\n[back to contents](##Contents)\n\n---"

      "<a id='ukcp18'></a>\n# Towards Climate Services\n\n\n* ## UKCP18: latest high resolution model output for the UK\n[UKCP](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index) stands for UK Climate Projections. UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

    "response": "Reanalysis products like **ERA5** are explicitly modeled datasets that assimilate observational data but are not direct observations themselves. As described in Context 6, ERA5 is a *reanalysis product*, meaning it is generated by running a climate model and adjusting it to fit observational data using techniques like 4D-var (Context 6). This process creates a \"best estimate\" of the climate state over time, but it remains a **model product** constrained by physical laws and computational limitations. For example, ERA5 interpolates between sparse observations (e.g., weather station data, satellite measurements) to produce a globally consistent dataset (Context 6). \n\nKey distinctions include:  \n1. **Not Observations**: ERA5 is not raw observational data but a model-generated product designed to approximate observations (Context 6).  \n2. **Interpolation**: Reanalysis datasets dynamically interpolate between observations, which can introduce biases or uncertainties compared to direct measurements (Context 6).  \n3. **Grid Dependency**: ERA5 data in NetCDF format are regridded to a regular lat/lon grid, which differs from the model’s native grid (Context 6).  \n\nOther reanalysis products, such as NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis or MERRA-2, follow similar principles (Context 6). Thus, while reanalysis datasets are invaluable for studying climate trends, they must be treated as **model-derived approximations** rather than direct observations.  \n\n**Answer**: Reanalysis products like ERA5 are model-derived datasets that assimilate observational data but are not direct observations (Context 6). They interpolate between sparse observations to create a globally consistent dataset, making them useful for analysis but distinct from raw measurements.",

[MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \n\n\n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\n\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \n\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \n\n\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \n\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \n\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \n\n[back to contents](##Contents)\n\n---"

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",
      "<a id='ukcp18'></a>\n# Towards Climate Services\n\n\n* ## UKCP18: latest high resolution model output for the UK\n[UKCP](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index) stands for UK Climate Projections. UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",

    "response": "Climate models are inherently incomplete and approximate representations of Earth’s complex systems, yet they remain indispensable tools for understanding climate dynamics and projecting future changes. This is because their utility lies not in perfect replication of observed data but in their ability to simulate physical processes and quantify uncertainties (Context 8). For instance, models cannot fully capture all interactions (e.g., the effect of \"Z\" on climate mentioned in Context 4), but they are internally consistent and provide valuable insights into past and present climate patterns (Context 7).  \n\nKey uncertainties in climate models arise from several sources:  \n1. **Numerics and equations**: Approximations in solving equations (Context 5).  \n2. **Resolution**: Limited spatial/temporal detail, which affects the representation of phenomena like regional weather (Context 5).  \n3. **Parameterizations**: Simplifications of complex processes (e.g., cloud formation) that introduce errors (Context 5).  \n4. **Boundary conditions and forcing**: Uncertainties in external drivers like greenhouse gas concentrations (Context 5).  \n5. **Internal dynamics**: Natural variability within the climate system (Context 5).  \n\nThese uncertainties must be explicitly addressed when interpreting model results. For example, ensemble analysis (e.g., using multiple model runs like the HadGEM3-GC3.05 ensemble in Context 3) helps quantify how conclusions vary under different scenarios. This aligns with the principle that \"all models are wrong, but some are useful\" (Context 4).  \n\nWhile models cannot forecast the future with certainty, they are critical for exploring impacts, adaptation, and mitigation strategies (Context 6). Their value lies in their ability to simulate plausible futures under different scenarios (e.g., RCP8.5 in Context 3), even if they are \"fitted\" to historical data (Context 7). Thus, the skill of an analyst lies in balancing model limitations with the insights they provide, ensuring conclusions are robust to uncertainties (Context 5).  \n\nIn summary, climate models are not \"right\" in the absolute sense but are essential for advancing climate science and informing policy decisions, provided their uncertainties are transparently accounted for (Context 8).",

The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",

One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally.

ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow.

Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

      "---\n\n# <center> Environmental Data </center>\n\n---\n\n## Course objectives and philosophy\nLet's start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\n\n1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\n\nYou'll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \n\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \n\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \n\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\n\n## This segment of the module\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\n\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\n\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\n\n\n## We will focus and use climate data.\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \n\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \n___"

    "response": "The Environmental Data module emphasizes a structured approach to analyzing climate data, integrating technical skills with critical evaluation of uncertainties. To address the feedback, here’s a refined explanation leveraging the provided context:\n\n1. **Data Sources and Formats**: Climate data, such as ERA5 reanalysis (Context 6), provides gridded datasets interpolated to regular lat/lon grids, ideal for spatial analysis. However, users must distinguish between reanalysis products (model-based) and direct observations, as ERA5 incorporates assimilated data but remains a model output (Context 6). Similarly, CMIP6 datasets (Context 6) offer high-resolution climate projections, requiring attention to grid geometry and resolution limitations. NetCDF formats, while convenient, involve interpolation that may affect conservation properties of variables (Context 6).\n\n2. **Uncertainty and Error Sources**: Data analysis must account for uncertainties from multiple origins: measurement errors, environmental variability, and analytical procedures (e.g., calibration with synthetic data) (Context 7). For instance, ERA5’s 4D-var assimilation reduces discrepancies but does not eliminate model biases (Context 6). Hypothesis testing is critical, ensuring each analysis step is framed as an experiment to validate or refute a specific goal (Context 8).\n\n3. **Workflow Design**: The module’s objectives stress designing workflows that balance technical competency with interpretive rigor. For example, when analyzing CMIP6 projections, users should first validate model outputs against reanalysis datasets like ERA5 (Context 6), then apply statistical tools while acknowledging computational constraints (Context 8). This aligns with the philosophy of treating data analysis as a hypothesis-driven process, prioritizing study objectives over exploratory tangents (Context 8).\n\n4. **Practical Tools and Challenges**: The course integrates Jupyter notebooks and GitHub repositories (Context 8) to practice handling 2D/3D/4D data. Challenges like grid wrap-around in ERA5 (Context 6) or large dataset sizes (Context 8) require careful handling, emphasizing the need for software that manages geographic coordinates effectively. Dropbox links (Context 8) provide access to supplementary data, though users must remain mindful of computational limits.\n\nBy systematically addressing these aspects, the module equips learners to navigate climate data complexities while adhering to scientific rigor.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \n\n\n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\n\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \n\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \n\n\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \n\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \n\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

    "response": "The question of how to use climate models and reanalysis products like ERA5 to quantify climate impacts requires a nuanced approach that integrates model outputs with observational data. Here's a structured explanation:\n\n1. **Climate Models for Impact Quantification**  \n   Climate models are essential for simulating future climate scenarios and assessing potential impacts (e.g., extreme weather, sea-level rise). These models incorporate physical processes (e.g., atmospheric dynamics, ocean circulation) and are calibrated using historical data to improve accuracy (Context 2). For example, models can project temperature trends under different emissions scenarios, enabling policymakers to evaluate adaptation strategies (Context 3). However, models inherently have uncertainties due to simplified representations of complex systems (Context 7).\n\n2. **ERA5 Reanalysis as a Validation Tool**  \n   ERA5, a reanalysis product from ECMWF, combines model simulations with real-world observations to create a consistent, high-resolution dataset spanning decades (Context 4). This makes it ideal for validating climate models. By comparing model outputs (e.g., temperature, precipitation) with ERA5 data, researchers can identify biases and refine model parameters. For instance, discrepancies between modeled and observed rainfall patterns can inform improvements in convective parameterization schemes (Context 5).\n\n3. **ESMValTool for Data-Model Analysis**  \n   The Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) provides a framework to systematically compare climate models with observational datasets like ERA5 (Context 5). This tool automates diagnostics (e.g., trend analysis, spatial pattern comparisons) and helps quantify model performance across different regions and timescales. For example, ESMValTool can assess how well a model captures the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, which is critical for regional climate predictions.\n\n4. **Addressing Model Limitations**  \n   While models are invaluable, their limitations must be acknowledged. For instance, unresolved processes like cloud microphysics or ocean eddies can introduce errors in regional projections (Context 7). Reanalysis products like ERA5 mitigate some of these issues by incorporating observational constraints, but they also have limitations (e.g., sparse data in remote regions). Combining model outputs with reanalysis data thus provides a more robust basis for impact assessments.\n\nIn summary, climate models and reanalysis products like ERA5 are complementary tools. Models project future scenarios, while reanalysis data validate these projections and refine model accuracy. Tools like ESMValTool bridge the gap by enabling rigorous comparisons, ensuring that climate impacts are quantified with both scientific rigor and practical relevance.",

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

    "response": "ERA5, as a reanalysis product, is a model that assimilates observational data to produce a consistent global climate record (Context 7). However, its utility depends on understanding its grid geometry and inherent uncertainties.  \n\n**Grid Geometry and Data Formats**:  \nERA5 data in **GRIB format** retains the model’s native grid geometry, which is not a regular lat/lon grid (Context 7). This can affect spatial interpolation and conservation of variables. In contrast, **NetCDF format** data are automatically regridded to a regular lat/lon grid, simplifying analysis but introducing potential discrepancies due to interpolation (Context 7). Users must be cautious about the implications of this regridding, especially for variables sensitive to spatial resolution.  \n\n**Longitude Wrap-Around**:  \nERA5 uses a [0°–360°] longitude grid, where 0° and 360° represent the same geographic point. This wrap-around can cause artifacts in analyses if software does not handle it correctly (Context 7). For example, adjacent grid columns may appear distant in index space but are geographically close. Tools that convert data to [-180°–180°] format are recommended to avoid misinterpretation.  \n\n**Sources of Uncertainty**:  \nERA5, like all reanalysis products, is subject to uncertainties from:  \n1. **Model Resolution and Parameterizations**: Coarser resolution and simplified physical processes may limit accuracy (Context 6).  \n2. **Boundary Conditions and Forcing**: Assimilation of observational data introduces biases, especially in regions with sparse measurements (Context 6).  \n3. **Internal Dynamics**: Natural variability in the climate system can lead to uncertainties in short-term predictions (Context 6).  \n4. **Analytical Errors**: Interpolation and regridding in NetCDF formats may distort variables, requiring careful validation (Context 8).  \n\n**Implications for Data Analysis**:  \nWhen using ERA5, analysts must account for these uncertainties and grid-specific challenges. For instance, studies relying on high-resolution spatial analysis should prioritize GRIB data while being aware of its computational demands. Conversely, NetCDF’s convenience may come at the cost of reduced fidelity for certain variables (Context 8).  \n\nUltimately, ERA5 provides a valuable tool for climate research, but its application requires a nuanced understanding of its limitations and the broader uncertainties inherent in environmental data (Context 8).",

      "<a id='question'></a>\n\n# Driving question to answer this week: \nIt is ok to learn techniques and go through practicals, but the overal objective of this course is to equip you with the skills needed to pursue your own analyses. With this in mind, we are going to work towards a central question, to motivate learning though the next few lessons.  \n\n\n* ## Should French Champagne makers invest in wineries in Hampshire (UK)?\n\nRecently, [french champagne producer Tattinger have decided to invest in a winery in Kent, called Domaine Evremond](https://www.domaineevremond.com).  Tattinger is aware that other English wineries in [Hampshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampshire) are also [producing excellent sparkling wine](https://www.visit-hampshire.co.uk/food-and-drink/vineyards). \n\nTattinger's business wing is of course concerned about this. Are these new UK wineries going to be strong competitors for them, or should Tattinger see these as investment opportunities and try to buy them while they can to establish a stronger presence in the UK market?\n\nLike everyone else, Tattinger is also aware about climate change and they realize that, from now on, they need to systematically incorporate a climate analysis as part of their business decisions.  \n\nFrom the growing success of English winemakers, Tattinger can see that the current climate in the Hampshire region is good enough at the moment for growing good grapes, but they want to know if and how climate change will affect the current climate in Hampshire. Ultimately, they want to know if climate change could affect the wine buisness in Hampshire. Will climate change negatively affect viticulture in the region, should we expect little change, or are conditions actually going to become even better for growing grapes in the next few decades? \n\nImagine that your new start-up, as an up-and-coming climate intelligence company, is being contacted by representatives from Tattinger HQ to advise them on how climate will change in Hampshire. They want to know how climate change may affect wineries in Hampshire in the coming 50 years or so and they are looking for someone to deliver answers.  \n\n**Your task is to i) develop a research strategy that will answer their questions on the future of climate in Hampshire, ii) present initial results on the issue, and iii) issue a preliminary recommendation as to wether Tattinger should or should not invest in UK wineries going forward.**\n\nSadly, time is of the essence! Tattinger has heard that [Moet-et-Chandon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moët_&_Chandon), another major champagne producer, is also eyeing on these buisness opportunities and they must make a decision quickly. **You will be expected to produce a jupyter notebook by Thursday afternoon that summarizes your analysis and recommendations to Tattinger. While you will not be required to submit this code, you will be able to refer back to it during the final assessed quiz, so doing a thorough job will help. The final quiz will certainly ask questions related to this experience, such as file formats, limitations of data, etc.** \n\nIn your analysis, consider which data you want to use, how to get them (can you access and analyze them already?), what could be learned from them. Consider resolution, data use policy, data storage and analytical requirements (would you need to use a cloud service or supercomputer do perform the analysis? if so, could you use this for free as a commercial entity, if not, how much could that cost?). You may also want to use output from reanalysis products (e.g. ERA5) or climate models (UKCP18, CMIP, etc.). \n\nUse any and all resources at your disposal (including your instructor and your classmates) but keep in mind that **this is a commercial project**, so beware of any data use or resource access policies in place. In the real world, it could be that addressing this question would imply some costs that could be passed on to the client. However, the rules for this exercise are to only use open-acess resources. \n\nYou don't have much time, but this could be a big and important contract for your new company so you want to develop a good solution, ideally with some preliminary results to showcase your skills, and prove to Tattinger that you are the right people for the job. Your company could earn future business from them! \n\n**IMPORTANT**: Although you are encouraged to exchange with your classmates and exchange ideas, source of data, and work in groups, you will only be able to rely on your own code during the quiz.** \n\n---",
      "We see how the Zivot_Andrews results are much clearer in this case, with a p-values for the periodic case that is undeniably larger than 5% (we would make a big mistake by rejecting the null-hypothesis of non-stationarity!). This example shows how one needs to understand how parameteric tests behave and probably shouldn't 'just believe' them blindly. In this example, the critical aspect is of course the signal-to-noise in 'periodic_walk1'. The amplitude of the periodic signal is weak compared to the magnitude of the random noise, and this can make it harder for the tests to detect the non-stationarity. This shows also that there is not aways a clear line between weak-stationarity and non-stationarity. ",

      "#### Variograms, correlograms and semi-variograms\n\nKrigging requires estimation of a so-called covariance matrix, which describes the relationship between observations. Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\n\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \n\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\n  \\begin{equation}\n    \\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\left(1-exp\\left(\\frac{-h}{ra}\\right)\\right)+n_{(0,\\infty)}\n  \\end{equation}\n    \n2. Gaussian semivariogram model\n  \\begin{equation}\n    \\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\left(1-exp\\left(\\frac{h^2}{a^2}\\right)\\right)+n_{(0,\\infty)}\n  \\end{equation}\n  \n3. Spherical semivariogram model\n  \\begin{equation}\n  \\gamma(h) =\n  \\begin{cases}\n    (s-n)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{h}{a}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{h}{a}\\right)^3 \\right)+n_{(0,\\infty)} & \\text{for }h\\le a,\\\\\n    (s-n) & \\text{for }h > a.\n  \\end{cases}\n  \\end{equation}\n\n\nIn the functions above, $h$ is distance. $s$ is called the `sill`, the value that $\\gamma(h)$ tends to as h goes to $\\infty$. $r$ is the `range`, or the distance at which the difference $\\gamma(h)-s$ becomes negligible. $n$ is called the `nugget` parameter. It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\n\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\n\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\n\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\n\n\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$. At this point, one can either compute the **spatial covariance**\n\n\\begin{equation}\nC(k \\Delta h)=\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k\\Delta h)d(x_i)\n\\end{equation}\n\nfrom which we can compute the **correlogram**, which is simply the spatial covariance normalized by the data variance (at $k=0$) so as to limit its range to $\\pm 1$,\n\n\\label{eq:corelogram}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\rho(k \\Delta  h)=\\frac{C(k \\Delta h)}{C(0)}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k \\Delta  h)d(x_i)}{\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^m(d(x_i)^2)}\n\\end{equation}\n\nor look at the mean squared difference and form the **semivariogram**\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\gamma(k \\Delta  h)=\\frac{1}{2m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^m\\left(d(x_i+k\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\right)^2.\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe functional forms $C(h)$, $\\rho(h)$ or $\\gamma(h)$ of these binned, discrete estimates is obtained simply by plotting $C(k\\Delta h)$, $\\rho(k\\Delta  h)$ or $\\gamma(k\\Delta  h)$ as a function of $k\\Delta h$ and by fitting a polynomial throught the results that ensures strictly positive values of $C(h)$, $\\rho(h)$ or $\\gamma(h)$ for any $h$.\n\nNote that the corelogram in geostatistics is very similar to the autocorrelation function used in time-series analysis. Indeed, as the lag-distance increases, both $\\rho(h)$ and $C(h)$ decrease, while $\\gamma(h)$ increases.\n\n---"

    "response": "The analysis of climate data for Tattinger’s project requires a nuanced approach that integrates statistical rigor, model limitations, and geostatistical techniques. Here’s a structured response addressing the feedback:  \n\n1. **Zivot-Andrews Test for Non-Stationarity**:  \n   When analyzing time-series data (e.g., temperature or CO₂ trends), the Zivot-Andrews test (Context 5) is critical for detecting structural breaks. For instance, if the p-value for a periodic signal is above 5% (e.g., in a weak signal-to-noise ratio scenario), we cannot reject the null hypothesis of non-stationarity. This highlights the test’s sensitivity to noise and the need to interpret results cautiously. Such insights are vital for validating climate datasets, as non-stationarity could invalidate trend analyses (Context 5).  \n\n2. **Model Limitations and Uncertainties**:  \n   Climate models inherently face challenges in quantifying interactions between variables like CO₂, temperature (T), and other factors (Context 6). For example, models may miss unquantified feedbacks (e.g., cloud formation or oceanic absorption), leading to uncertainties in projections. While models are internally consistent (Context 6), their utility depends on the quality of inputs and the ability to account for unmodeled processes. This underscores the importance of using open-access reanalysis products (e.g., ERA5) alongside models to cross-validate results.  \n\n3. **Anisotropic Variograms for Spatial Analysis**:  \n   For spatial data (e.g., oceanic tracers), anisotropic variograms (Context 8) are essential. Unlike isotropic models, anisotropic variograms account for directional dependencies, such as Earth’s rotation restricting meridional motions. For example, in oceanography, longitudinal ranges are longer than latitudinal ones, requiring directional adjustments in variogram fitting. Empirical variogram estimation (Context 8) can be used to derive semivariograms or correlograms, ensuring accurate spatial interpolation via krigging. This approach is particularly relevant for high-resolution datasets, where directional heterogeneity must be captured.  \n\nBy integrating these methods, the analysis",

      "<a id='ukcp18'></a>\n# Towards Climate Services\n\n\n* ## UKCP18: latest high resolution model output for the UK\n[UKCP](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index) stands for UK Climate Projections. UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",

It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

      "<a id='timedomain'></a>\n# Modeling time series data in the time domain\n\nOne of the tenet of time series analyis, or statistical forecasting of time series, is that: \n\n$\nData = Signal + Noise\n$\n\nMany approaches to time series analysis therefore try to decompose the data into an interpretable, signal, part and into uninterpretable residuals, which ideally are white noise. The signal can be additive, with trends, periods, and errors, e.g. $X_t=T_t+S_t+E_t$, or multiplicative, e.g. $X_t=T_t \\cdot S_t \\cdot E_t$, where the amplitude of variations of the data could be changing through time. \n\nThere are many types of models for time series data, each of which can take various forms and represent different stochastic processes. However, three broad classes are very common and of practical importance: \n1.  the autoregressive (AR) models, \n2.  the integrated (I) models, and \n3.  the moving average (MA) models. \n   \nThese three types of models all depend linearly on previous data points (other classes of models exist), and use that information to make a forecast into the future. One is generally interested in [developing these models to forecast](https://medium.com/wegaw/time-series-forecasting-in-python-from-zero-to-neural-networks-in-only-a-month-8e12d6a6e2f4), statistically, the (possibly future) behaviour of the data. Another useful application is to simulate the behaviour of observed random processes (e.g. to use as input to other models, or propagate errors).\n\nCombinations of ideas underlying the AR and MA models produce  **autoregressive moving average ([ARMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive–moving-average_model)) models**, while combination of all three types yields the **autoregressive integrated moving average ([ARIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average)) models** . The **autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average model ([ARFIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_fractionally_integrated_moving_average))**  generalizes all of this by allowing non-integer values of the 'differencing parameter'.\n\n",

    "response": "To address the question of accessing and working with climate data, the following structured approach integrates key concepts from the provided context:  \n\n1. **Data Sources and Access**:  \n   - **ESGF (Earth System Grid Federation)** and **CEDA (UK Centre for Environmental Data Analysis)** are critical platforms for accessing climate data (Context 4). ESGF provides global datasets from models and observations, while CEDA hosts UK-specific data, including the **UKCP18 climate service** (Context 3). These platforms require user registration and often involve data portals or APIs for retrieval.  \n   - **Reanalysis products** like **ERA5** (Context 4) offer gridded, high-resolution datasets that assimilate observational data into models, making them ideal for historical climate analysis. ERA5 is produced by ECMWF and accessible via the Copernicus Climate Change Service.  \n\n2. **File Formats and Metadata**:  \n   - **NetCDF** (Context 6) is a standard format for climate data, supporting multidimensional arrays and metadata via the **CF Conventions** (Context 5). Metadata ensures reproducibility and clarity, describing variables (e.g., temperature, pressure) and their spatial/temporal attributes.  \n   - **GRIB** format (Context 4) is used for native model outputs but requires regridding to regular lat/lon grids for analysis. NetCDF files, while convenient, involve interpolation that may affect variable conservation properties.  \n\n3. **Tools for Data Manipulation**:  \n   - **NCO (NetCDF Operators)** and **CDO (Climate Data Operators)** (Context 6) are essential for processing NetCDF files. These tools enable operations like regridding, filtering, and statistical analysis, streamlining workflows for climate research.  \n   - **ESMValTool** (Context 4) is a framework for evaluating Earth System Models, integrating data from ESGF and CEDA to assess model performance against observations.  \n\n4. **Modeling and Reanalysis**:  \n   - **Reanalysis products** (Context 4) like ERA5 combine models with observational data to create consistent, gridded datasets. While not direct observations, they provide a \"best estimate\" of past climate states, crucial for understanding trends and variability.  \n   - **Observational System Simulation Experiments (OSSE)** (Context 5) highlight the interplay between models and data assimilation, emphasizing that even \"reanalysis\" remains a model product constrained by physical laws and computational limits.  \n\nBy leveraging these resources and tools, researchers can effectively access, analyze, and interpret climate data, bridging the gap between observational records and model simulations.

While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

    "response": "To establish a framework for comparing climate models' accuracy in simulating the Labrador Sea overturning circulation:  \n- Use **reanalysis products** (e.g., ERA5) as a reference, which assimilate observations to create high-resolution spatio-temporal datasets (Context 7).  \n- Compare models using **MIP (Model Intercomparison Project)** protocols, emphasizing experimental design with control and sensitivity experiments (Context 3).  \n- Evaluate resolution impacts: higher-resolution models (e.g., 10km vs. 100km cells) better capture eddies and small-scale processes critical for overturning circulation (Context 1).  \n- Assess agreement with observations by aligning model outputs to **data points** (spatial/temporal) and quantifying uncertainties (Context 4).  \n- Prioritize models resolving key processes like air-sea heat fluxes and ocean dynamics (Context 1).  \n\nCitations: (Context 1), (Context 3), (Context 4), (Context 7).",
