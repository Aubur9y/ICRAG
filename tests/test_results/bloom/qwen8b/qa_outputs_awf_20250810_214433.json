As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753903424262111, 'score': 0.650537, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_38_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='reanalysis'></a>\\n\\n# Reanalysis products\\n\\n![C3S](img/c3s-logo.png)\\n![ECMWF](img/logo-ecmwf.png) \\n\\n[*ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables. The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753901956989969, 'score': 0.64801896, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_2', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g.calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).Learning objectives of the Environmental Data module•Growing/important field –with likely career opportunities•Great playground to deliver learning objectives\\nUsing climate models: quantification/forecasting(impacts, adaptation, mitigation)\\nhttps://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts\\nUsing climate models: designscenarios(explore policy,', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf', 'chunk_number': 2}}, {'id': 1753902702944729, 'score': 0.646374, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_9', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'task.

NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\\n\\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \\n\\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\\n\\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\\n\\n\\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)). [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu) also manages [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu), one of the first center to have developped climate models and is today one of the gold-standard on the topic. \\n\\nNCAR also developed [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu), an interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization (we will not use NCL here, but the python package `ESMValTool` has build-in support for it). \\n\\n[NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu) has also developped the [climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu), a tool to search and access >200 data sets specific to the ocean, land and the atmosphere.

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}]"

    "response": "The provided text covers key aspects of **climate modeling**, **data formats**, and **data assimilation**. Here's a structured summary of the main topics and their relevance:\n\n\n- **Discretization and Grid Resolution**:\n  - Smaller grid steps improve topography/bathymetry representation (e.g., mountains, seamounts).\n  - Grid-box vertical walls (coordinate system-dependent) affect dynamics (e.g., pressure gradients, turbulence).\n  - Subgrid-scale processes (e.g., eddies, overflows) require parameterization, balancing resolution vs. computational cost.\n\n- **Model Dynamics**:\n  - Property gradients (e.g., temperature, salinity) influence pressure gradients and velocity.\n  - Models become more advective (less diffusive) with higher resolution, potentially increasing turbulence.\n\n- **Observational Integration**:\n  - **Reanalysis Products**: Combine models with observational data (e.g., 4DVAR data assimilation) for improved accuracy.\n  - **Observational System Simulation Experiments (OSSE)**: Test model-data integration without real observations.\n\n\n- **NetCDF**:\n  - A self-describing, portable, and scalable format for scientific data.\n  - Supports metadata (e.g., units, spatial/temporal coordinates) for reproducibility.\n  - Widely used in climate science (e.g., IPCC models, reanalysis datasets).\n\n- **Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions**:\n  - Standardize metadata for netCDF files (e.g., `standard_name`, units, coordinates).\n  - Ensure data is \"self-describing\" for analysis, comparison, and automation.\n  - Example: A variable labeled \"temperature\" must specify if it's air, land, or ocean surface temperature.\n\n- **Other Formats**:\n  - **GRIB**: Common for weather forecasts; supported by tools like CDO.\n  - **HDF5**: Used for large datasets but less common in climate science.\n\n\n- **Climate Data Operators (CDO)**:\n  - Over 600 operators for processing climate data (e.g., calculating indices, diagnostics).\n  - Supports NetCDF/GRIB formats; efficient for batch processing.\n\n- **NCL (NCAR Command Language)**:\n  - An interpreted language for scientific data analysis and visualization.\n  - Integrated with ESMValTool for climate model diagnostics.\n\n- **ESMValTool**:\n  - A Python-based framework for evaluating climate models and reanalysis data.\n  - Supports CF Conventions and NetCDF formats.\n\n\n- **Reanalysis Products**:\n  - Combine models with real-world observations (e.g., ERA5, MERRA-2).\n  - Critical for weather forecasting and climate studies.\n  - Example: NASA’s MERRA-2 assimilates satellite and in-situ data.\n\n- **Data Assimilation Techniques**:\n  - **4DVAR**: Optimizes model states using observational data over time.\n  - **Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF)**: Uncertainty quantification in data assimilation.\n\n\n- **Model Limitations**:\n  - Subgrid-scale processes (e.g., cloud formation) require parameterization, introducing uncertainties.\n  - Resolution trade-offs: Higher resolution improves dynamics but increases computational cost.\n\n- **Data Quality**:\n  - Historical datasets often lack metadata, hindering climate change analysis.\n  - CF Conventions address this by standardizing metadata for reproducibility.\n\n- **Interoperability**",

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}]",

NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\\n\\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \\n\\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\\n\\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\\n\\n\\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)). [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu) also manages [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu), one of the first center to have developped climate models and is today one of the gold-standard on the topic. \\n\\nNCAR also developed [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu), an interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization (we will not use NCL here, but the python package `ESMValTool` has build-in support for it). \\n\\n[NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu) has also developped the [climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu), a tool to search and access >200 data sets specific to the ocean, land and the atmosphere.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

    "response": "The provided code snippet demonstrates how to use Python's `glob` module to locate all NetCDF (`*.nc`) files in a directory named `output`. Here's a breakdown of its functionality and context:\n\n```python\nimport glob\nncfiles = glob.glob(\"output/*.nc\")\nprint(ncfiles)\n```\n- **Purpose**: This script searches the `output` directory for files ending with `.nc` (NetCDF format, commonly used in climate science for storing multidimensional data).\n- **Output**: It prints a list of file paths matching the pattern, which can be used for further processing (e.g., reading data into a Python environment).\n\n\n1. **Climate Data Handling**:\n   - NetCDF files are prevalent in climate modeling and observational data (e.g., temperature, precipitation, atmospheric variables).\n   - Tools like **xarray** (Python) or **NCL** (NCAR's NCAR Command Language) are often used to analyze these files.\n\n2. **Integration with Tools**:\n   - **CF Conventions**: NetCDF files typically adhere to the **Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata conventions**, ensuring consistency in data representation.\n   - **ERDDAP/NOAA**: If the data is from oceanic or atmospheric sources, tools like **ERDDAP** (a data server by NOAA) might be used for retrieval.\n\n3. **Organizations & Repositories**:\n   - **CEDA** (Climate Data Store) or **ESGF** (Earth System Grid Federation) might host these files, requiring access via APIs or direct file paths.\n   - **NCAR** (National Center for Atmospheric Research) develops tools like **NCL** and **climate data guides** for analysis.\n\n4. **Workflow Continuation**:\n   - After identifying files, you might load them using `xarray`:\n     ```python\n     import xarray as xr\n     ds = xr.open_mfdataset(ncfiles)\n     ```\n   - Or visualize with **Matplotlib**/**Cartopy** for spatial analysis.\n\n\n- **Climate Models**: These files could represent outputs from models like **CMIP6** (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project), validated against observational data.\n- **Data Masking**: Tools like **Masks** (in climate science) might be used to isolate regions of interest (e.g., land, ocean).\n- **Ensemble Modeling**: If the files are from multiple simulations, ensemble analysis could be performed to assess uncertainty.\n\n\n1. **Data Analysis**: Use `xarray` or `netCDF4` libraries to load and analyze the data.\n2. **Visualization**: Plot results using `matplotlib` or `cartopy` for geospatial context.\n3. **Automation**: Extend the script to process files dynamically (e.g., by year, model, or variable).\n\nThis code is a foundational step in workflows involving climate data, bridging raw files with analytical tools.

    "response": "The provided context discusses key concepts in **climate modeling**, **numerical discretization**, and **spatial interpolation techniques**. Here's a structured summary of the main ideas:\n\n\n- **Numerical Schemes for Solving Equations**:  \n  Climate models solve partial differential equations (PDEs) describing physical processes (e.g., fluid dynamics, heat transfer). These equations are discretized using numerical methods:  \n  - **Forward Difference**:  \n    $$\n    \\frac{dC}{dt} \\approx \\frac{C_{i+1} - C_i}{\\Delta t}\n    $$  \n    (Explicit scheme; computationally efficient but less stable for large time steps).  \n  - **Backward Difference**:  \n    $$\n    \\frac{dC}{dt} \\approx \\frac{C_i - C_{i-1}}{\\Delta t}\n    $$  \n    (Implicit scheme; more stable for stiff systems but requires solving equations iteratively).  \n  - **Centered Difference**:  \n    $$\n    \\frac{dC}{dt} \\approx \\frac{C_{i+1} - C_{i-1}}{2\\Delta t}\n    $$  \n    (Higher accuracy but requires knowledge of neighboring points).  \n\n  These choices impact **numerical stability**, **accuracy**, and **computational cost** (e.g., implicit schemes may require matrix inversion).\n\n- **Grid Structure and Resolution**:  \n  - Climate models use **regular grids** (e.g., latitude/longitude) or **irregular grids** (e.g., unstructured meshes).  \n  - **Discretization parameters** (e.g., $ \\Delta x, \\Delta y, \\Delta t $) determine spatial and temporal resolution.  \n  - **Subgrid-scale processes** (e.g., turbulence, cloud formation) are parameterized when they cannot be resolved directly.\n\n\n- **Gridded vs. Scattered Data**:  \n  - **Gridded data** (regularly spaced) allows efficient interpolation using methods like:  \n    - **`interpn`** (Scipy): N-dimensional interpolation for regular grids.  \n    - **Finite differences** for derivatives.  \n  - **Scattered data** (irregularly spaced) requires more complex methods, such as:  \n    - **Kriging** or **radial basis functions** (RBFs).  \n    - **Triangulation-based interpolation** (e.g., Delaunay triangulation).  \n\n- **Computational Efficiency**:  \n  - Gridded data benefits from **vectorized operations** (e.g., using arrays **X, Y** for coordinates), reducing computational overhead.  \n  - Scattered data requires **sorting and searching** for nearby points, increasing computational cost.  \n\n- **Interpolation Challenges**:  \n  - **",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\\n\\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \\n\\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\\\left(1-exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-h}{ra}\\\\right)\\\\right)+n_{(0,\\\\infty)}\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\n    \\n2.

It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$.

It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902702662417, 'score': 0.60848176, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_10', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ls that are ‘fitted’ to data•Some model parameters are tuned to fit–Question is what to fit/how?

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902703226725, 'score': 0.6494485, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_13', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' model do it all?Processes operate on various time/space scales\\nHigher resolution•(more data)•(local extremes)•(shorter simulation)•(no/few ensembles)Lower resolution•(fewer data)•(longer simulation)•(many ensembles)\\n\\nTake home messages•Models will always be imperfect (accept this!)–the challenge is to make them useful by keeping them as simple as possible in spite oftheir limitations •very difficult in practice, requires deep scientific knowledge•Understanding of the question and of the tools a', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf', 'chunk_number': 13}}, {'id': 1753903424509295, 'score': 0.64907897, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 01- Introduction to climate data and climate models\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n## Contents\\n- [Lectures](#lectures)\\n- [Question](#question)\\n- [ESMValTool](#ESMValTool)\\n- [Sources of climate data](#climatedata)\\n- [CEDA](#CEDA)\\n- [File formats](#fileformat)\\n- [Metadata](#metadata)\\n- [NetCDF](#NetCDF)\\n- [NCO](#NCO)\\n- [Reanalysis products](#reanalysis)\\n- [Climate services UKCP18](#ukcp18)\\n  \\n## Learning outcomes\\n1.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}]",

    "response": "To evaluate the accuracy of climate models and select the best model for a specific analysis, consider the following key factors and methodologies:\n\n\n- **Resolution**:  \n  Higher-resolution models capture smaller-scale processes (e.g., cloud dynamics, regional climate patterns) but require more computational resources. However, even high-resolution models may miss sub-grid processes (e.g., microphysics of cloud formation) due to spatial averaging.  \n  - *Example*: Grid cells in models are often larger than the scales of physical processes (e.g., cloud formation), leading to approximations in parameterizations.\n\n- **Numerical Schemes**:  \n  The choice of numerical methods (e.g., advection schemes, time-stepping algorithms) affects conservation properties (mass, momentum, energy) and introduces numerical diffusion or errors.  \n  - *Example*: Poorly chosen schemes may artificially smooth gradients, altering climate feedbacks.\n\n- **Parameterizations**:  \n  Simplified representations of complex processes (e.g., turbulence, radiation, convection) introduce uncertainties. Models with more refined parameterizations for critical variables (e.g., precipitation, aerosol effects) may improve accuracy for specific analyses.\n\n- **Boundary Conditions and Initial States**:  \n  Accurate representation of initial conditions (e.g., atmospheric state, sea surface temperatures) and boundary conditions (e.g., land use, greenhouse gas concentrations) is critical for reliable simulations.\n\n- **Ensemble Runs**:  \n  Running multiple simulations (ensembles) helps quantify uncertainties due to initial conditions, parameterizations, and model structure. This distinguishes \"internal variability\" (natural climate fluctuations) from \"forced responses\" (driven by external factors like CO₂ emissions).\n\n\n- **Comparison with Observations**:  \n  - Use observational datasets (e.g., reanalysis products, satellite data) to validate model outputs.  \n  - Metrics like **bias**, **root mean square error (RMSE)**, and **correlation coefficients** can assess agreement for variables like temperature, precipitation, or wind patterns.  \n  - *Example*: A model may reproduce the mean state of temperature well but fail to capture seasonal variability.\n\n- **Multi-Model Ensembles**:  \n  - Combine results from multiple models to reduce uncertainties. The **multi-model mean** often provides a more robust estimate than individual models.  \n  - Identify models that consistently perform well for specific variables (e.g., a model excelling in simulating precipitation but underperforming in temperature trends).\n\n- **Sensitivity Analysis**:  \n  - Test how model outputs change with variations in inputs (e.g., greenhouse gas concentrations, land use changes) to assess robustness.  \n  - *Example*: A model that shows consistent responses to CO₂ increases is more reliable for future projections.\n\n- **Process-Based Evaluation**:  \n  - Validate models against physical constraints (e.g., energy balance, water cycle closure) rather than just statistical metrics.  \n  - *Example*: A model that fails to conserve energy may have flawed dynamics, even if it matches observational trends.\n\n\n- **Define the Purpose**:  \n  - For **regional climate studies**, prioritize",

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753902703299772, 'score': 0.6258123, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_3', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'l sense of incomplete/uncertain results and design meaningful experiments(experimental design is key)\\nModel resolutionIncreasing spatial resolution…also means increasing temporal resolution to maintain numerical stability(i.e.decrease time step)Huge cost of resolution:2x increase in spatial resolution in all dimensions means 23=8x more computations23=8x more memory23=8x more timeWith decreased time-step>16x slower and more demanding\\nBenefits of improving resolution?•Better numerical accuracy in ', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf', 'chunk_number': 3}}, {'id': 1753903968752811, 'score': 0.61702776, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_21_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='fitting'></a>\\n# Surface fitting\\n\\nThe interpolation techniques described above work very well when the space is relatively well-sampled, when one does not want to extrapolate beyond the convex hull and in the absence of variability or uncertainties associated the control points.

    "response": "The analysis of spatial data involves two primary approaches: **interpolation** and **surface fitting**. These methods are used to estimate values across a spatial domain based on observed data points, each with distinct characteristics and applications.\n\n\nInterpolation creates a surface that **passes exactly through all control points**. It is ideal for well-sampled data where extrapolation beyond the convex hull is avoided.  \n- **Gridded Data**: Techniques like `interp2d` (in Python) assume regular spacing and efficient computation using finite differences.  \n- **Scattered Data**: Tools like `scipy.interpolate.griddata` use **Delaunay triangulation** to interpolate within triangles formed by data points. Options include:  \n  - **Nearest neighbor**: Fast but less smooth.  \n  - **Linear**: Smooth interpolation across triangles.  \n  - **Cubic**: Higher-order smoothing, suitable for continuous fields.  \n\n**Limitations**:  \n- Struggles with discontinuities (e.g., mountains or ocean boundaries).  \n- May produce artifacts if data is sparse or noisy.  \n\n\nSurface fitting minimizes the error between predicted and observed values without forcing the surface to pass through each point. This approach is better for handling uncertainties and variability.  \n- **Kriging**: A statistical method pioneered by Danie G. Krige and formalized by Georges Matheron. It uses a **covariance matrix** to weigh data points based on spatial correlation.  \n  - Produces smoother surfaces, reducing overfitting to noise.  \n  - Accounts for measurement uncertainties and spatial dependencies.  \n- **Applications**: Ideal for environmental data (e.g., soil moisture, temperature) where data gaps exist or noise is present.  \n\n**Key Considerations**:  \n- The shape of the fitted surface depends on data distribution, uncertainties, and subjective choices (e.g., covariance model).  \n- Balances accuracy with generalization, avoiding overfitting to noisy measurements.  \n\n\n- **Gridded Data**: Efficient due to regular spacing, enabling fast finite difference calculations.  \n- **Scattered Data**: Requires additional steps (e.g., triangulation) and is computationally more intensive.  \n\n\n- **Algorithm Limitations**: \"Out-of-the-box\" tools may fail to respect natural boundaries (e.g., continents in oceanographic data). Advanced methods (e.g., kriging) address these challenges.  \n- **Resolution Trade-offs**: Higher spatial resolution increases computational costs (e.g., 2x resolution → 8x more computations).  \n- **Data Uncertainty**: Surface fitting explicitly incorporates measurement noise, while interpolation assumes perfect data.  \n\n\n- **Interpolation** is precise but rigid, suitable for dense, noise-free data.  \n- **Surface fitting** (e.g., kriging) is flexible, handling sparse data and uncertainties.  \n- Computational efficiency varies by data type, with scattered data requiring more resources.  \n- Choosing the right method depends on data quality, spatial variability, and the need for smoothness vs. fidelity to measurements.  \n\nThis framework underpins applications in environmental science, geostatistics, and spatial modeling, where accurate and efficient spatial analysis is critical.",

These are particularly useful when a process can take on a finite number of states, with varying probabilities. \\n\\nA system consisting of mutually exclusive states and probabilistic transitions between them is called a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) (after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov).\\n\\nThey are often linked to a technique called [`Markov Chain Monte Carlo`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo), which are a class of algorithms for sampling from a probability distribution. This is very useful for numerical error propagation. By constructing a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution, one can obtain a sample of the desired distribution by recording states from the chain. The [`Metropolis-Hastings algorightm`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis–Hastings_algorithm) is also key to certain non-linear global optimization algorithms, such as [`simulated annealing`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing). \\n\\nOne widely used analogy to explain Markov Chains is the 'drunken sailor' moving between his ship to the local pub (...the sailor being so drunk that he can move forwards, backwards, or not move at all):\\n\\n> [A drunken sailor moves from a tavern to his ship. The distance between the tavern and the ship is N steps. With each intermediate step, the sailor has chance **f** of stepping forward, chance **b** of stepping backward, and chance of **1-f-b** of standing still. Where does the sailor end up at the end of the day?](https://medium.com/pragmatic-programmers/what-shall-we-do-with-a-drunken-sailor-c57d9b61339d)\\n\\n\\nTo illustrate, assume there are 4 steps (N=4) between the ship and the tavern.\\n\\n![drunkensailor](img/drunkensailor.png)\\n\\nIn this case, the system comprising the sailor, the tavern, and the path with steps between the two can be in one of the N+1=5 **states** S[i]: \\n1. the sailor is in the tavern; \\n2. the sailor is 1 step away from the tavern; \\n3. the sailor is halfway from the tavern (i.e. 2 steps from anything); \\n4. the sailor is 1 step away from the ship;  \\n5. the sailor is on the ship. \\n   \\nThe probability of being in each state is **p[i]**, and the sum of all probabilities is 1 (the sailor must be at least somewhere).\\n\\nThere are also the probabilities **q[i,j]** of **moving** from the state S[i] to the state S[j]. For instance, if we were to set q[0,0], this could mean that the sailor **is** (S[i]) in the tavern, and **going** to the tavern (S[j]), so he has not actually gone anywhere in this case, but the quantity q[i,j] let's us represent the probability of each move happeneing. In this case, from the tavern, the sailor cannot go backwards, only forwrads towards the ship, so q[0,0]=1-f (i.e. the probability of staying in the tavern is equal to the probability of *not* moving forward).\\n\\nImagine, we start with the state that the sailor **is** in the tavern, so we can say p[0]=1, and set all other p[i]=0. \\n\\nFrom that starting point, we can now imagine what happens during the next step, i.e. the sailor can either move one step forward (i.e. out of the tavern, i.e. p[0] would decrease and p[1] would increase), or stay in the tavern. Whatever happens, though, the drunken sailor has **no memory** of what he did last time...as he is drunk, so each new move is independent of the last move, in a memoryless fashion. \\n\\nThe fact that moves are memoryless does not mean that probabilities of being a state cannot be calculated between steps though. During the second step, the probability of being in step 2, p[2] will depend on wether the sailor was in p[1] or p[0] after step 1, and this depends on the probabilities of moving (q[i,j], which ultimately depends on probabilities **f** and **b** or moving forward and backwards, and on the probabilities of being somewhere (p[i]). \\n\\nTo calculate the probabilities of the sailor being in any given state at a given time step, we simply need to keep track of all probabilities of getting there (q) from each current state (p), and sum them. \\n\\n$\\np’[i] = sum(p[j] · q[j,i])\\n$\\n\\nFor example, for the mid-way state, N=2, equidistant between the ship and the tavern, the probability of being there, i.e. in the new state p'[2] from any previous state 'p', can be represented by:\\n\\n$\\np'[2] = q[0,2] · p[0] + q[1,2]· p[1] + q[2,2]· p[2] + q[3,2]· p[3] + q[4,2]· p[4]\\n$\\n\\nand given our knowledge of the probabilities, we can simplify this as: \\n\\n$\\np’[2] = 0 · p[0] + f · p[1] + (1-f-b) · p[2] + b · p[3] + 0 · p[4]\\n$\\n\\nWe get get to N=2 by moving from step 1 forward, moving from step 3 backwards, or not moving from step 2. We cannot get to step 2 directly from step 0 or 4 (the tavern or the ship) as this would requires two steps (the sailor can only make one step at a time). \\n\\nWe can apply the same logic and calculate the probablilites of being anywhere. For example, the probability of being in step 1, p'[1] would be: \\n\\n$\\np'[1]=q[0,1] · p[0] + q[1,1]· p[1] + q[2,1]· p[2] + q[3,1]· p[3] + q[4,1]· p[4] \\\\\\\\\\np’[1] = f · p[0] + (1-f-b) · p[1] + b · p[2] + 0 · p[3] + 0 · p[4]  \\n$\\n\\nThe 'ps' and the 'qs' for all cases can be quantified and arranged into matrices **'P'** and **'Q'**, such that $P' = P · Q$. **P** is the state matrix, while **Q** is called the **transition** matrix. In the case of N=4, we see that the matrices P and Q are 5x5, or N+1 x N+1. A Markovian system is one where all we know is the current state and transition probabilities, but we don't know (or keep track) of what the previous states were (they don't affect the transition probabilities).\\n\\n\\nMarkovian systems ultimately become stationary in the sense that the distribution of the probabilities of being in each state converge towards stable distributions.

These are particularly useful when a process can take on a finite number of states, with varying probabilities. \\n\\nA system consisting of mutually exclusive states and probabilistic transitions between them is called a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) (after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov).\\n\\nThey are often linked to a technique called [`Markov Chain Monte Carlo`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo), which are a class of algorithms for sampling from a probability distribution. This is very useful for numerical error propagation. By constructing a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution, one can obtain a sample of the desired distribution by recording states from the chain. The [`Metropolis-Hastings algorightm`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis–Hastings_algorithm) is also key to certain non-linear global optimization algorithms, such as [`simulated annealing`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing). \\n\\nOne widely used analogy to explain Markov Chains is the 'drunken sailor' moving between his ship to the local pub (...the sailor being so drunk that he can move forwards, backwards, or not move at all):\\n\\n> [A drunken sailor moves from a tavern to his ship. The distance between the tavern and the ship is N steps. With each intermediate step, the sailor has chance **f** of stepping forward, chance **b** of stepping backward, and chance of **1-f-b** of standing still. Where does the sailor end up at the end of the day?](https://medium.com/pragmatic-programmers/what-shall-we-do-with-a-drunken-sailor-c57d9b61339d)\\n\\n\\nTo illustrate, assume there are 4 steps (N=4) between the ship and the tavern.\\n\\n![drunkensailor](img/drunkensailor.png)\\n\\nIn this case, the system comprising the sailor, the tavern, and the path with steps between the two can be in one of the N+1=5 **states** S[i]: \\n1. the sailor is in the tavern; \\n2. the sailor is 1 step away from the tavern; \\n3. the sailor is halfway from the tavern (i.e. 2 steps from anything); \\n4. the sailor is 1 step away from the ship;  \\n5. the sailor is on the ship. \\n   \\nThe probability of being in each state is **p[i]**, and the sum of all probabilities is 1 (the sailor must be at least somewhere).\\n\\nThere are also the probabilities **q[i,j]** of **moving** from the state S[i] to the state S[j]. For instance, if we were to set q[0,0], this could mean that the sailor **is** (S[i]) in the tavern, and **going** to the tavern (S[j]), so he has not actually gone anywhere in this case, but the quantity q[i,j] let's us represent the probability of each move happeneing. In this case, from the tavern, the sailor cannot go backwards, only forwrads towards the ship, so q[0,0]=1-f (i.e. the probability of staying in the tavern is equal to the probability of *not* moving forward).\\n\\nImagine, we start with the state that the sailor **is** in the tavern, so we can say p[0]=1, and set all other p[i]=0. \\n\\nFrom that starting point, we can now imagine what happens during the next step, i.e. the sailor can either move one step forward (i.e. out of the tavern, i.e. p[0] would decrease and p[1] would increase), or stay in the tavern. Whatever happens, though, the drunken sailor has **no memory** of what he did last time...as he is drunk, so each new move is independent of the last move, in a memoryless fashion. \\n\\nThe fact that moves are memoryless does not mean that probabilities of being a state cannot be calculated between steps though. During the second step, the probability of being in step 2, p[2] will depend on wether the sailor was in p[1] or p[0] after step 1, and this depends on the probabilities of moving (q[i,j], which ultimately depends on probabilities **f** and **b** or moving forward and backwards, and on the probabilities of being somewhere (p[i]). \\n\\nTo calculate the probabilities of the sailor being in any given state at a given time step, we simply need to keep track of all probabilities of getting there (q) from each current state (p), and sum them. \\n\\n$\\np’[i] = sum(p[j] · q[j,i])\\n$\\n\\nFor example, for the mid-way state, N=2, equidistant between the ship and the tavern, the probability of being there, i.e. in the new state p'[2] from any previous state 'p', can be represented by:\\n\\n$\\np'[2] = q[0,2] · p[0] + q[1,2]· p[1] + q[2,2]· p[2] + q[3,2]· p[3] + q[4,2]· p[4]\\n$\\n\\nand given our knowledge of the probabilities, we can simplify this as: \\n\\n$\\np’[2] = 0 · p[0] + f · p[1] + (1-f-b) · p[2] + b · p[3] + 0 · p[4]\\n$\\n\\nWe get get to N=2 by moving from step 1 forward, moving from step 3 backwards, or not moving from step 2. We cannot get to step 2 directly from step 0 or 4 (the tavern or the ship) as this would requires two steps (the sailor can only make one step at a time). \\n\\nWe can apply the same logic and calculate the probablilites of being anywhere. For example, the probability of being in step 1, p'[1] would be: \\n\\n$\\np'[1]=q[0,1] · p[0] + q[1,1]· p[1] + q[2,1]· p[2] + q[3,1]· p[3] + q[4,1]· p[4] \\\\\\\\\\np’[1] = f · p[0] + (1-f-b) · p[1] + b · p[2] + 0 · p[3] + 0 · p[4]  \\n$\\n\\nThe 'ps' and the 'qs' for all cases can be quantified and arranged into matrices **'P'** and **'Q'**, such that $P' = P · Q$. **P** is the state matrix, while **Q** is called the **transition** matrix. In the case of N=4, we see that the matrices P and Q are 5x5, or N+1 x N+1. A Markovian system is one where all we know is the current state and transition probabilities, but we don't know (or keep track) of what the previous states were (they don't affect the transition probabilities).\\n\\n\\nMarkovian systems ultimately become stationary in the sense that the distribution of the probabilities of being in each state converge towards stable distributions. When that happens,  $P = P’ = P’’ = P’’’ = ... = π$, that is the probability matrix that sets the probability of being in each state no longer evolves with each new iteration (i.e. the distribution of the probabilities describing the likelihood of being in each state p[i] doesn't change anymore with more iterations). When that happens, since p'[i]=p, we can write $\\\\pi=P=P'$ and so\\n\\n$\\n\\\\pi = \\\\pi \\\\cdot Q\\n$\\n\\nSince this represents a linear system, one could solve it for $\\\\pi$ and we see that $\\\\pi=eig(Q)$, so the probabilities of being in each state, given many steps through the random walk of the drunk sailor, are given by the eigenvalues of the transition matrix. Deriving this is beyond the scope of this introduction, but explanations can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). \\n\\nHere is a python example, assuming the drunken sailor is slightly more likely to go forward (f=0.7) than backward (b=0.2)...so maybe the sailor is not completely drunk yet. \", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_timeseriesanalysis-IC-X9CYXD36RX.ipynb', 'cell_number': 32}}, {'id': 1753907767204658, 'score': 0.6198261, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_timeseriesanalysis-IC-X9CYXD36RX.ipynb_cell_5_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='practice'></a>\\n## Practicing with stationarity and detrending\\n\\nAs an example, let's first create a few synthetic time series, using a `random walk` model, i.e. a sequence of random points, with a given variance, but that are uncorrelated from point to point.

    "response": "To address your query about **stationarity and detrending in time series analysis**, here's a structured explanation and practical approach:\n\n\nA time series is **stationary** if its statistical properties (mean, variance, autocorrelation) do not change over time. Key characteristics:\n- **Constant mean** (no trend).\n- **Constant variance** (no heteroscedasticity).\n- **Autocovariance depends only on lag, not time**.\n\n**Why it matters**: Many time series models (e.g., ARIMA, GARCH) assume stationarity. Non-stationary data can lead to unreliable forecasts.\n\n\nDetrending removes systematic patterns (e.g., linear or nonlinear trends) to achieve stationarity. Common methods:\n- **Differencing**: Subtract the previous observation (e.g., first-order differencing for random walks).\n  ```python\n  from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller\n  import pandas as pd\n\n  # Example: Random walk (non-stationary)\n  np.random.seed(42)\n  random_walk = np.cumsum(np.random.normal(0, 1, 100))\n  df = pd.DataFrame({'trend': random_walk})\n\n  # First-order differencing\n  df['detrended'] = df['trend'].diff().dropna()\n  ```\n- **Polynomial Regression**: Fit a trend line and subtract it.\n  ```python\n  from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\n  X = np.arange(len(df['trend'])).reshape(-1, 1)\n  y = df['trend'].values\n  model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)\n  df['detrended'] = df['trend'] - model.predict(X)\n  ```\n- **Seasonal Differencing**: For seasonal trends (e.g., monthly sales with yearly cycles).\n  ```python\n  df['seasonal_detrended'] = df['trend'].diff(12).dropna()  # 12-month lag\n  ```\n\n\nUse statistical tests to confirm stationarity:\n- **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test**:\n  ```python\n  result = adfuller(df['detrended'])\n  print('ADF Statistic:', result[0])\n  print('p-value:', result[1])\n  ```\n  - **p-value < 0.05**: Reject the null hypothesis (series is stationary).\n- **KPSS Test** (for trend stationarity):\n  ```python\n  from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import kpss\n  result = kpss(df['detrended'])\n  print('KPSS Statistic:', result[0])\n  print('p-value:', result[1])\n  ```\n\n\n\n```python\nnp.random.seed(42)\nrandom_walk = np.cumsum(np.random.normal(0, 1, 100))\n```\n- **Issue**: Mean and variance increase over time.\n- **Solution**: First-order differencing.\n\n```python\nseasonal_data = np.sin(np.linspace",

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian.

It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902702944729, 'score': 0.6145586, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_9', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'task.

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903424104630, 'score': 0.6000645, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_0_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '---\\n\\n# <center> Environmental Data </center>\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Course objectives and philosophy\\nLet\\'s start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\\n\\n1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\\n\\nYou\\'ll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \\n\\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \\n\\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \\n\\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\\n\\n## This segment of the module\\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\\n\\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \\nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \\nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\\n\\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\\n\\n\\n## We will focus and use climate data.\\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \\n\\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \\n___', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 0}}]",

I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424104630, 'score': 0.63940644, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_0_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '---\\n\\n# <center> Environmental Data </center>\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Course objectives and philosophy\\nLet\\'s start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\\n\\n1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\\n\\nYou\\'ll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \\n\\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \\n\\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \\n\\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\\n\\n## This segment of the module\\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\\n\\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \\nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \\nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\\n\\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\\n\\n\\n## We will focus and use climate data.\\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \\n\\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \\n___', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 0}}, {'id': 1753903424959234, 'score': 0.6372119, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_9_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '<a id=\\'Metadata\\'></a>\\n\\n## The importance of Metadata\\n[Metadata](https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/4428-metadata-basics) **relate to all the information necessary to interpret, understand and use a given dataset. Metadata are not the data themselves, but are required to provide context and therefore inform the data analysis.** \\n\\nThere are two types of metadata, \"**discover metadata**\", which can be used to locate the dataset in a search, and \"**detailed metadata**\", which contain the information necessary to use the data (ideally) without having to ask the data provider for more information (even if one of the key piece of information should be the data provider information and contact detail!).\\n\\nThere is no upper limit as to what information should be included in the metadata, but typical metadata comprise information about when and where the observations, or the file, where produced, how they were produced (which instrument, technique, algorithm were used), information about the experiment the data come from, maybe some information about data accuracy (if not provided as seperate data in the file), information about who produced the data or the file, including contact information, or appropriate reference(s), and, if relevant, additional information about the research context, i.e. which project is associated with these data (this could help the user understand if more data from this group/project exist or can be expected). If the data represent a subset of a larger dataset, this should also be mentioned. \\n\\nAnother key pieces of information that the metadata should provide are a description of the variables in the file, with variable **names**, and the **units** of these variables. \\n\\nIf the data in the file represent a processed version of other raw data, then one should add information about these raw data as well, their provenance, references, and the transformation that was made, etc. One should be able to track the chain of information all the way to the orginal observations (or model output). \\n\\nIf the data represent gridded variables, then the nature of the grid on which these data are defined should also be explained. \\n\\nSimilarly, if the position, or some other features of the data, depend on a reference system, that reference system should be given. This will be discussed in more depth during the introduction to geostatistics lecture. \\n\\nIn the case of climate models (or other models, if relevant), the metadata should also include information about the model itself, the model name, version, the length of the integration, maybe a brief description of the spin-up, boundary conditions, initial conditions used to produce the simulation. \\n\\nObviously the information that will be included in the metadata vary substantially. You should learn (and will discover - mostly through shear frustration when key information is missing!) what constitute useful metadata in your field of work. \\n\\nMetadata can be included in the file itself (if the file format allows it), as separate files, or in the form of some other documents. When sourcing data, always make a note of where the data come from. This is especially true if getting data online as it is very easy to download data and then forget where they come from. Detailed note-taking is part of the job of the data analyst (and that of any scientist!). \\n\\nWhen metadata is included in the file directly, this typically comes as a header, or in a specified location in the file. The netCDF format has rules for how/where to include metadata, which is one of the reason why netCDF data are particularly useful and popular in climate science. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 9}}, {'id': 1753903424595753, 'score': 0.6368768, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_40_code', 'type': 'code', 'content': \"#!/usr/bin/env python\\n# \\n# example useage of the CDS API: https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+download+ERA5#HowtodownloadERA5-3-DownloadingonlineERA5familydatathroughtheCDSwebinterface\\n#\\n# Downloading Air Temperature on the 1000 hPa level for a Jan 1st 2021 at 12:00.\\n#\\n\\nimport cdsapi\\n \\nc = cdsapi.Client()\\n \\nc.retrieve(\\n    'reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels',\\n    {\\n        'product_type': 'reanalysis',\\n        'variable': 'temperature',\\n        'pressure_level': '1000',\\n        'year': '2021',\\n        'month': '01',\\n        'day': '01',\\n        'time': '12:00',\\n        'format': 'netcdf',     # NetCDF format\\n    },\\n    'output/ERA5test.nc')       # Output file.

NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\\n\\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \\n\\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\\n\\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\\n\\n\\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)). [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu) also manages [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu), one of the first center to have developped climate models and is today one of the gold-standard on the topic. \\n\\nNCAR also developed [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu), an interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization (we will not use NCL here, but the python package `ESMValTool` has build-in support for it). \\n\\n[NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu) has also developped the [climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu), a tool to search and access >200 data sets specific to the ocean, land and the atmosphere.

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753902300206271, 'score': 0.62169266, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_0', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'Climate models –what are they?\\n…and different grids for different parts of the model:atmosphere, ocean, land, ice,…\\n\\nA bit of review: What do we need to make a model?(Any model, not necessarily a climate one)\\nWhat does a model need?A very simple analytical exampledCdt=λRequires equations (hypotheses about underlying physics)\\nWhat does a model need?A very simple analytical exampledCdt=λdCCoCf∫=λdttotf∫Cf=λtf−to()−CoRequires initial &boundary conditionsRequires equations (hypotheses about underlyi', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 0}}]",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753903424959234, 'score': 0.69783413, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_9_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '<a id=\\'Metadata\\'></a>\\n\\n## The importance of Metadata\\n[Metadata](https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/4428-metadata-basics) **relate to all the information necessary to interpret, understand and use a given dataset. Metadata are not the data themselves, but are required to provide context and therefore inform the data analysis.** \\n\\nThere are two types of metadata, \"**discover metadata**\", which can be used to locate the dataset in a search, and \"**detailed metadata**\", which contain the information necessary to use the data (ideally) without having to ask the data provider for more information (even if one of the key piece of information should be the data provider information and contact detail!).\\n\\nThere is no upper limit as to what information should be included in the metadata, but typical metadata comprise information about when and where the observations, or the file, where produced, how they were produced (which instrument, technique, algorithm were used), information about the experiment the data come from, maybe some information about data accuracy (if not provided as seperate data in the file), information about who produced the data or the file, including contact information, or appropriate reference(s), and, if relevant, additional information about the research context, i.e. which project is associated with these data (this could help the user understand if more data from this group/project exist or can be expected). If the data represent a subset of a larger dataset, this should also be mentioned. \\n\\nAnother key pieces of information that the metadata should provide are a description of the variables in the file, with variable **names**, and the **units** of these variables. \\n\\nIf the data in the file represent a processed version of other raw data, then one should add information about these raw data as well, their provenance, references, and the transformation that was made, etc. One should be able to track the chain of information all the way to the orginal observations (or model output). \\n\\nIf the data represent gridded variables, then the nature of the grid on which these data are defined should also be explained. \\n\\nSimilarly, if the position, or some other features of the data, depend on a reference system, that reference system should be given. This will be discussed in more depth during the introduction to geostatistics lecture. \\n\\nIn the case of climate models (or other models, if relevant), the metadata should also include information about the model itself, the model name, version, the length of the integration, maybe a brief description of the spin-up, boundary conditions, initial conditions used to produce the simulation. \\n\\nObviously the information that will be included in the metadata vary substantially. You should learn (and will discover - mostly through shear frustration when key information is missing!) what constitute useful metadata in your field of work. \\n\\nMetadata can be included in the file itself (if the file format allows it), as separate files, or in the form of some other documents. When sourcing data, always make a note of where the data come from. This is especially true if getting data online as it is very easy to download data and then forget where they come from. Detailed note-taking is part of the job of the data analyst (and that of any scientist!). \\n\\nWhen metadata is included in the file directly, this typically comes as a header, or in a specified location in the file. The netCDF format has rules for how/where to include metadata, which is one of the reason why netCDF data are particularly useful and popular in climate science. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 9}}, {'id': 1753903424143550, 'score': 0.6958612, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_11_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='NetCDF'></a>\\n\\n## Network Common Data Form (NetCDF)\\n\\n[NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) is one of the most common data format used to store climate data. NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\\n\\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \\n\\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\\n\\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\\n\\n\\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)). [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu) also manages [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu), one of the first center to have developped climate models and is today one of the gold-standard on the topic. \\n\\nNCAR also developed [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu), an interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization (we will not use NCL here, but the python package `ESMValTool` has build-in support for it). \\n\\n[NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu) has also developped the [climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu), a tool to search and access >200 data sets specific to the ocean, land and the atmosphere.

It is a component of ESGF. \\n\\nCEDA has two main branches: \\n1. [CEDA-Archive: https://archive.ceda.ac.uk](https://archive.ceda.ac.uk) \\n2. [JASMIN: https://jasmin.ac.uk](https://jasmin.ac.uk)\\n\\n[CEDA-Archive](https://archive.ceda.ac.uk) serves as the national (UK) data centre for atmospheric and earth observation research. It currently holds >18 Petabytes of atmospheric and earth observation data from a variet of sources, such as aircraft campaigns, satellites imagery, automatic weather stations, climate models, etc. \\n\\nCEDA is one of 5 UK data centers, comprising the Environmental Data Service ([EDS](https://nerc.ukri.org/research/sites/environmental-data-service-eds/)), supported by the UK Research and Innovation\\'s National Environmental Research Council (NERC). The 5 centers are \\n1. British Oceanographic Data Centre (Marine), \\n2. CEDA (Atmospheric, Earth Observation, and Solar and space physics), \\n3. Environmental Information Data Centre (Terrestrial and freshwater), \\n4. National Geoscience Data Centre (Geoscience), and \\n5. Polar Data Centre (Polar and cryosphere). \\n   \\nAs the focus is on climate here, CEDA is the most relevant, but it is useful to know of these resources if you end up working in other fields. \\n\\nCEDA also serves as the Data Distribution Center ([DDC](https://www.ipcc-data.org)) for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch)).\\n\\n[JASMIN](https://jasmin.ac.uk) is a data intensive supercomputer for environmental science. It currently supports over 160 projects ranging from climate science and oceanography to air pollution, earthquake deformation or biodiversity studies. JASMIN consists of multi-Petabyte fast storage, co-located with data analysis computing facilities. This would be the \"go-to\" tool for processing large amounts of climate data, which are directly linked to the system (through CEDA). We will here work offline (using local storage), but JASMIN and CEDA are useful resources for anyone working in environmental science in the UK (most nations don\\'t have these facilities - they are rare and valuable!). \\n\\nSince CEDA and JASMIN are linked, the **compute power is linked to the data**, making for an efficient environment for data analysis. \\n\\n#### Getting access\\n\\nObviously, maintaining these facilities has a cost and therefore not all users will have the same access priviledges. Members of educational, academic and research institutions in the UK can often access these infrastructures for free (pending one can demonstrate need and subject to a fair-use policy). Use and access will likely not be free for commercial applications.  \\n\\n**Use your Imperial College London email adresses (or from another UK institution) to register!**\\n\\nIn order to use the CEDA-Archive, it is necessary to first [register for an account](https://services.ceda.ac.uk/cedasite/register/info/). This is generally quick, easy and free.\\n\\nSimilarly, access to JASMIN requires an account, but this involves a more complex multi-step process. First, one must ask for a [JASMIN portal account](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4435-get-a-jasmin-account). If granted, one can then register for a [jasmin-login account] (https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/161-get-login-account). The type of account given will depend on need and priviledges requested. Users granted jasmin-login access get a HOME directory of 100GB of storage and can access the shared JASMIN servers (Scientific servers, data transfer servers, and the LOTUS HPC cluster).\\n   \\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 6}}, {'id': 1753903424509295, 'score': 0.6868166, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 01- Introduction to climate data and climate models\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n## Contents\\n- [Lectures](#lectures)\\n- [Question](#question)\\n- [ESMValTool](#ESMValTool)\\n- [Sources of climate data](#climatedata)\\n- [CEDA](#CEDA)\\n- [File formats](#fileformat)\\n- [Metadata](#metadata)\\n- [NetCDF](#NetCDF)\\n- [NCO](#NCO)\\n- [Reanalysis products](#reanalysis)\\n- [Climate services UKCP18](#ukcp18)\\n  \\n## Learning outcomes\\n1.

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753901956747387, 'score': 0.70660853, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_1', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.4.

    "response": "The provided text spans multiple documents related to **climate data, modeling, and tools**, with key themes including:\n\n\n- **Model Limitations**:  \n  - Climate models face challenges in spatial/temporal resolution, integration time steps, and simplifying physical equations (e.g., neglecting certain physics).  \n  - Comparing models with observational data is complex:  \n    - Are model outputs spatially/temporally comparable to real-world data?  \n    - How to define \"data points\" (e.g., observational samples vs. model results)?  \n\n- **Coupled Climate Models**:  \n  - Ocean-atmosphere coupling mechanisms are critical for accurate simulations.  \n  - The \"coupler\" is the core component of climate models, integrating interactions between subsystems (e.g., atmosphere, ocean, ice).  \n\n\n- **Data Formats**:  \n  - **NetCDF** and **GRIB** are standard formats for climate data.  \n  - Tools like **CDO** (Climate Data Operators) and **NCO** (NetCDF Operators) process these datasets efficiently.  \n  - **CDO** supports over 600 operators for climate diagnostics and is often used for gridded data analysis.  \n\n- **ESMValTool**:  \n  - A Python-based tool for evaluating climate models, supporting both model outputs and observational data.  \n  - Integrates with **ESGF** (Earth System Grid Federation) for large-scale data access.  \n  - Useful for diagnosing model biases and analyzing climate scenarios (e.g., impact assessments).  \n\n- **Python Environments**:  \n  - **ESMValTool** is recommended for advanced workflows, though installation can be complex (requires `mamba` or `conda`).  \n  - Other tools like **Julia**, **R**, and **NCL** are also supported for climate analysis",

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903968752811, 'score': 0.6311593, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_21_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='fitting'></a>\\n# Surface fitting\\n\\nThe interpolation techniques described above work very well when the space is relatively well-sampled, when one does not want to extrapolate beyond the convex hull and in the absence of variability or uncertainties associated the control points. If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\\n\\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \\n\\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement. The contoured estimate will tend to either over or underestimate the true value, within a tolerance controlled by the noise associated with the measurements. \\n\\nThe shape of the fitted surface will depend strongly on the data available: their locations, their uncertainties, as well as subjective choices made during the analysis (i.e. definition of the so-called 'covariance matrix').\\n\\nWe will here look at a technique called **kriging**, pioneered by a South African mining engineer called Danie G.

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903968752811, 'score': 0.65398085, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_21_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='fitting'></a>\\n# Surface fitting\\n\\nThe interpolation techniques described above work very well when the space is relatively well-sampled, when one does not want to extrapolate beyond the convex hull and in the absence of variability or uncertainties associated the control points. If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\\n\\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \\n\\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement. The contoured estimate will tend to either over or underestimate the true value, within a tolerance controlled by the noise associated with the measurements. \\n\\nThe shape of the fitted surface will depend strongly on the data available: their locations, their uncertainties, as well as subjective choices made during the analysis (i.e. definition of the so-called 'covariance matrix').\\n\\nWe will here look at a technique called **kriging**, pioneered by a South African mining engineer called Danie G.

Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\\n\\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \\n\\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\\n1.

It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$. At this point, one can either compute the **spatial covariance**\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nC(k \\\\Delta h)=\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k\\\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nfrom which we can compute the **correlogram**, which is simply the spatial covariance normalized by the data variance (at $k=0$) so as to limit its range to $\\\\pm 1$,\\n\\n\\\\label{eq:corelogram}\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\rho(k \\\\Delta  h)=\\\\frac{C(k \\\\Delta h)}{C(0)}=\\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k \\\\Delta  h)d(x_i)}{\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^m(d(x_i)^2)}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nor look at the mean squared difference and form the **semivariogram**\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\gamma(k \\\\Delta  h)=\\\\frac{1}{2m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^m\\\\left(d(x_i+k\\\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\\\right)^2.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nThe functional forms $C(h)$, $\\\\rho(h)$ or $\\\\gamma(h)$ of these binned, discrete estimates is obtained simply by plotting $C(k\\\\Delta h)$, $\\\\rho(k\\\\Delta  h)$ or $\\\\gamma(k\\\\Delta  h)$ as a function of $k\\\\Delta h$ and by fitting a polynomial throught the results that ensures strictly positive values of $C(h)$, $\\\\rho(h)$ or $\\\\gamma(h)$ for any $h$.\\n\\nNote that the corelogram in geostatistics is very similar to the autocorrelation function used in time-series analysis.

NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\\n\\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \\n\\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\\n\\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\\n\\n\\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)). [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu) also manages [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu), one of the first center to have developped climate models and is today one of the gold-standard on the topic. \\n\\nNCAR also developed [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu), an interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization (we will not use NCL here, but the python package `ESMValTool` has build-in support for it). \\n\\n[NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu) has also developped the [climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu), a tool to search and access >200 data sets specific to the ocean, land and the atmosphere.

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}]",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\\n\\nYou\\'ll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \\n\\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \\n\\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \\n\\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\\n\\n## This segment of the module\\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\\n\\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \\nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \\nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\\n\\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\\n\\n\\n## We will focus and use climate data.\\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \\n\\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \\n___', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 0}}]",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753903424104630, 'score': 0.63885343, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_0_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '---\\n\\n# <center> Environmental Data </center>\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Course objectives and philosophy\\nLet\\'s start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\\n\\n1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\\n\\nYou\\'ll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \\n\\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \\n\\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \\n\\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\\n\\n## This segment of the module\\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\\n\\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \\nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \\nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\\n\\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\\n\\n\\n## We will focus and use climate data.\\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \\n\\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \\n___', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 0}}, {'id': 1753902300429530, 'score': 0.63570035, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_6', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ce scales of interest–Integration time step–Spatial resolution of the grid–Duration of model run–Decisions about time/space scales also translate into “filtering” the equations •(parts of the equations can be neglected and the equations simplified –some physics can be neglected/simplified)\\nWhy model climate?\\n\\nWeather and climate –bridging the gap\\n\\n\\nWhat are coupledclimatemodels?\\n\\nA few key major coupling mechanisms between the ocean and the atmosphere\\nThe “coupler” is the heart of climate models', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 6}}, {'id': 1753902702662417, 'score': 0.6322106, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_10', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ls that are ‘fitted’ to data•Some model parameters are tuned to fit–Question is what to fit/how?

If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\\n\\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \\n\\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement.

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753905536915787, 'score': 0.60405016, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_timeseriesanalysis.ipynb_cell_33_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='spectral'></a>\\n# Spectral analysis and frequency domain analysis\\n\\nSo far, all the methods discussed applied to the so-called 'time domain'. \\n\\nIt is possible, and often desireable, to transform the original detrended data (but still containing periodic signals) into the [`frequency domain`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_domain). \\n\\nTypical techniques for frequency domain analysis are the `Fourier transform` and `wavelet analysis`.

The big question is what values should the weight corresponding to each sample have? Answering this question is not easy - it is basically the whole point of kriging. The answer will depend on any additional constraints that one applies on these weights and on any additional properties one wishes the field $F$ or $D$ to have (stationarity of various moments, isotropy, etc.). Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}]",

Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\\n\\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \\n\\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\\\left(1-exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-h}{ra}\\\\right)\\\\right)+n_{(0,\\\\infty)}\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\n    \\n2.

It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$. At this point, one can either compute the **spatial covariance**\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nC(k \\\\Delta h)=\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k\\\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nfrom which we can compute the **correlogram**, which is simply the spatial covariance normalized by the data variance (at $k=0$) so as to limit its range to $\\\\pm 1$,\\n\\n\\\\label{eq:corelogram}\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\rho(k \\\\Delta  h)=\\\\frac{C(k \\\\Delta h)}{C(0)}=\\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k \\\\Delta  h)d(x_i)}{\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^m(d(x_i)^2)}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nor look at the mean squared difference and form the **semivariogram**\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\gamma(k \\\\Delta  h)=\\\\frac{1}{2m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^m\\\\left(d(x_i+k\\\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\\\right)^2.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nThe functional forms $C(h)$, $\\\\rho(h)$ or $\\\\gamma(h)$ of these binned, discrete estimates is obtained simply by plotting $C(k\\\\Delta h)$, $\\\\rho(k\\\\Delta  h)$ or $\\\\gamma(k\\\\Delta  h)$ as a function of $k\\\\Delta h$ and by fitting a polynomial throught the results that ensures strictly positive values of $C(h)$, $\\\\rho(h)$ or $\\\\gamma(h)$ for any $h$.\\n\\nNote that the corelogram in geostatistics is very similar to the autocorrelation function used in time-series analysis.

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424509295, 'score': 0.6697271, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 01- Introduction to climate data and climate models\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n## Contents\\n- [Lectures](#lectures)\\n- [Question](#question)\\n- [ESMValTool](#ESMValTool)\\n- [Sources of climate data](#climatedata)\\n- [CEDA](#CEDA)\\n- [File formats](#fileformat)\\n- [Metadata](#metadata)\\n- [NetCDF](#NetCDF)\\n- [NCO](#NCO)\\n- [Reanalysis products](#reanalysis)\\n- [Climate services UKCP18](#ukcp18)\\n  \\n## Learning outcomes\\n1.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753902300429530, 'score': 0.69203234, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_6', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ce scales of interest–Integration time step–Spatial resolution of the grid–Duration of model run–Decisions about time/space scales also translate into “filtering” the equations •(parts of the equations can be neglected and the equations simplified –some physics can be neglected/simplified)\\nWhy model climate?\\n\\nWeather and climate –bridging the gap\\n\\n\\nWhat are coupledclimatemodels?\\n\\nA few key major coupling mechanisms between the ocean and the atmosphere\\nThe “coupler” is the heart of climate models', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 6}}, {'id': 1753902702794239, 'score': 0.69060874, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_8', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'cool and warm the climateThe microphysics responsible for cloud formation is not well understoodThe grid cells in models are much much bigger than time/space scales relevant for cloud physicsÞMagnitude/location of rain events is hard to predict wellÞThat information is useful though!\\nComparing models with data•What is a data point?

NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\\n\\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \\n\\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\\n\\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\\n\\n\\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)).

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753901956917450, 'score': 0.65810513, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_3', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' technology options)\\n\\nUsing climate models: variability(temporal, spatial)\\nImportance of experimental design!Control+ experiment\\nUsing climate models: uncertainties and sensitivities\\nMIP = Model Intercomparison Project\\nEyring et al. 2016\\nUsing climate models: uncertainties and sensitivities\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_ensembleDifferent experimentswith many ensembles!Each one trying to account for sensitivity due to a source of error Real world data: we only have one Earth, ONE realizat', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf', 'chunk_number': 3}}]"

Here's a structured summary of the main ideas:\n\n\n- **NetCDF (Network Common Data Form)**:\n  - A self-describing file format for storing multidimensional scientific data.\n  - Supports metadata conventions (e.g., **CF Conventions**) to ensure data is easily interpretable and comparable.\n  - Key features: \n    - **Self-describing datasets** (variables, units, coordinates).\n    - **CF Conventions** (Climate and Forecast Metadata Conventions) are widely used in climate science to standardize variable names, units, and spatial/temporal metadata.\n    - Example: Variables like \"temperature\" are standardized to avoid ambiguity (e.g., \"air_temperature\" vs. \"surface_temperature\").\n\n- **CF Conventions**:\n  - Ensure data files are **self-describing** by defining:\n    - Physical units (e.g., Kelvin, meters).\n    - Spatial and temporal coordinates.\n    - Standard names for variables (e.g., \"relative_humidity\").\n  - Critical for climate science to track changes over time and space.\n\n\n- **NCO (NetCDF Operators)**:\n  - A suite of command-line tools for processing NetCDF files (e.g., calculating averages, regridding).\n  - Often used alongside **CDO (Climate Data Operators)** for climate data analysis.\n\n- **CDO (Climate Data Operators)**:\n  - A collection of tools for analyzing and processing climate data (e.g., calculating climatologies, diagnostics).\n  - Complements NCO for tasks like ensemble averaging or spatial aggregation.\n\n- **ESMValTool**:\n  - A Python-based tool for evaluating Earth System Models (ESMs) and reanalysis data.\n  - Supports CF conventions and integrates with NCO/CDO for data processing.\n\n\n- **Reanalysis** combines **model simulations** with **observed data** to produce consistent, long-term datasets (e.g., ERA5 from ECMWF).\n- Used for:\n  - Weather forecasting.\n  - Climate research (e.g., studying historical climate trends).\n  - Comparing model outputs with real-world observations.\n\n\n- **Clouds and Radiative-Convective Equilibrium**:\n  - Clouds influence both **albedo** (cooling) and **greenhouse effect** (warming).\n  - Relative humidity (RH) decreases with temperature, affecting cloud formation and precipitation patterns.\n  - Uncertainties in cloud behavior remain a major challenge for climate models.\n\n- **Observational System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs)**:\n  - Simulate how future observations (e.g., satellite data) would improve model accuracy.\n  - Used to evaluate data assimilation techniques (e.g., 4DVAR).\n\n- **Hydrologic Cycle and Desert Feedbacks**",

    "response": "The provided contexts highlight key aspects of climate modeling, numerical methods, and grid structures. Here's a structured summary of the critical points:\n\n\n- **Discretization** is essential for solving continuous equations (e.g., fluid dynamics) in climate models. It involves approximating derivatives using finite differences:\n  - **Forward Euler**: Simple but prone to instability due to its explicit nature.\n  - **Backward Euler**: Implicit method that ensures stability but requires solving systems of equations.\n  - **Centered Difference**: Higher accuracy for spatial derivatives but may introduce oscillations if not properly filtered.\n- **Time Step (Δt)** and **Spatial Grid Spacing (Δx, Δy, Δz)** are critical for numerical stability and accuracy. Smaller steps improve resolution but increase computational cost.\n\n\n- **Spatial Resolution**: Higher resolution (e.g., 2x in all dimensions) increases computational load by **8x** (due to more grid points) and memory usage. Temporal resolution must also improve to maintain stability, further increasing costs.\n- **Trade-offs**: While higher resolution improves accuracy (e.g., capturing small-scale features like eddies), it demands significant computational resources. For example:\n  - A 2x resolution increase in 3D leads to **~16x slower** simulations.\n  - **Subgrid-scale processes** (e.g., parameterizing unresolved turbulence) must be explicitly modeled when resolution is insufficient.\n\n\n- **Regular vs. Irregular Grids**:\n  - **Regular grids** (fixed latitude/longitude steps) are rare in native models due to curved geometries and variable resolution.\n  - **Irregular grids** (e.g., curvilinear or unstructured) are common, requiring **arrays X, Y** for spatial evaluation rather than vectors (x, y).\n- **Model Output**: Latitude/longitude data may be provided as vectors or grids, depending on the model's native structure. This affects how functions are evaluated over the grid.\n\n\n- **Topography and Bathymetry**: Smaller grid spacing improves representation of features like mountains or seamounts.\n- **Parameterization vs. Resolution**: Subgrid-scale processes (e.g., eddies) must be parameterized if they cannot be resolved, impacting model dynamics (e.g., pressure gradients, turbulence).\n- **Numerical Stability**: Balancing resolution and time steps is crucial to avoid instabilities (e.g., oscillations or divergence in simulations).\n\n\n- **Experimental Design**: Higher resolution requires careful validation to ensure it captures relevant processes without excessive computational cost.\n- **Model Calibration**: Idealized simulations (e.g., with known analytical solutions) are used to test",

    ],
    "response": "The critical analysis of the statement \"Are climate models any good or useful at all?\" hinges on balancing their inherent limitations with their practical applications. Here's a structured evaluation:\n\nClimate models are **not perfect**, but they are **useful**. The statement's truth depends on context:  \n- **Limitations**:  \n  1. **Resolution and Complexity**: Models operate at resolutions that cannot capture small-scale processes (e.g., cloud microphysics, local weather patterns). This leads to **parameterization**—approximating complex systems, which introduces uncertainties.  \n  2. **Data Assimilation**: Models are \"tuned\" to fit historical data, which can create a **feedback loop** where models may overfit past trends rather than predict future scenarios accurately.  \n  3. **Uncertainty in Physics**: Processes like ocean currents, ice-albedo feedback, or atmospheric chemistry are simplified, leading to **incomplete representations** of Earth's systems.  \n\n- **Utility**:  \n  1. **Predictive Power**: Despite imperfections, models have successfully predicted large-scale trends (e.g., global warming, El Niño patterns) and inform policy decisions (e.g., IPCC reports).  \n  2. **Scenario Analysis**: Models simulate future climate scenarios (e.g., RCPs) to assess risks, enabling mitigation strategies.  \n  3. **Scientific Insight**: They help identify critical feedback mechanisms (e.g., carbon cycle interactions) and test hypotheses about climate dynamics.  \n\n1. **Assumption of Perfection**: The statement may assume models are flawless, which is **misleading**. Models are inherently approximate tools, not exact replicas of reality.  \n2. **Assumption of Irrelevance**: The claim that models are \"useless\" ignores their role in **quantifying uncertainty** and guiding adaptive policies.  \n3. **Assumption of Simplicity**: Models are complex systems themselves, requiring interdisciplinary collaboration to refine their accuracy.  \n\n- **Resolution Trade-offs**: Higher resolution (e.g., regional models) sacrifices computational feasibility, while lower resolution (global models) misses localized impacts",

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424509295, 'score': 0.68558395, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 01- Introduction to climate data and climate models\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n## Contents\\n- [Lectures](#lectures)\\n- [Question](#question)\\n- [ESMValTool](#ESMValTool)\\n- [Sources of climate data](#climatedata)\\n- [CEDA](#CEDA)\\n- [File formats](#fileformat)\\n- [Metadata](#metadata)\\n- [NetCDF](#NetCDF)\\n- [NCO](#NCO)\\n- [Reanalysis products](#reanalysis)\\n- [Climate services UKCP18](#ukcp18)\\n  \\n## Learning outcomes\\n1.

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753903424368210, 'score': 0.6700366, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_2_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='lectures'></a>\\n# Lecture on relevance of climate science, climate models and climate modelling\\n\\n\\n(see Powerpoint presentations)\\n\\n1. 01v1_Why_climate_data.pptx/pdf\\n2. 02v1_Building_climate_models.pptx/pdf\\n3. 03v1_Common_issues.pptx/pdf\\n   \\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 2}}, {'id': 1753903424142956, 'score': 0.66586244, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_4_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='ESMValTool'></a>\\n\\n# Python environments to consider for working with climate data \\n\\n* ## Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool)\\n![esmvaltool](img/ESMValTool-logo-2.png)\\n\\nThis week, it should be possible to simply install packages as needed...\\n\\nHowever, if you anticipate possible future needs, you may want to invest a bit of effort to setup a specific python environment to work with climate data.

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424804905, 'score': 0.7343097, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_42_code', 'type': 'code', 'content': \"#!/usr/bin/env python\\nimport cdsapi\\n \\nc = cdsapi.Client()\\n \\nc.retrieve(\\n    'reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels',\\n    {\\n        'product_type': 'reanalysis',\\n        'variable': 'temperature',\\n        'pressure_level': '1000',\\n        'year': '2021',\\n        'month': '01',\\n        'day': '01',\\n        'time': '12:00',\\n        'format': 'netcdf',                         # NetCDF\\n        'area'          : [60., -11., 34., 35.],    # Default area is global; provide [North, West, South, East] limits to select an area (here selecting Europe)\\n        'grid'          : [1.0, 1.0],               #  Default atmospheric resolution is 0.25 x 0.25; provie [Latitude/longitude] grid resolution to interpolate data to something else.           \\n    },\\n    'output/ERAtest_subarea_1deg1deg.nc')           # Output file.

It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753903967981470, 'score': 0.65562856, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_0_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 03 Environmental Data: Thinking spatially\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n* ## Contents\\n- [Spatial data](#spatial)\\n- [Surface interpolation](#surface)\\n- [Gridded data](#gridded)\\n- [Scattered data](#scattered)\\n- [Surface fitting](#fitting)\\n- [Plotting and manipulating spatial data](#plotting)\\n- [Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)](#crs)\\n- [Geopandas](#geopandas)\\n- [Cartopy](#cartopy)\\n- [A nicer example](#example)\\n  \\n* ## Learning outcomes\\n1.

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902702944729, 'score': 0.7134025, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_9', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'task.

    "response": "To work with **ERA5 reanalysis data** using the **CDS API**, follow these steps and considerations:\n\n\n- **ERA5** is a high-resolution reanalysis dataset (0.25°–0.1° grid) from ECMWF, combining observations and models to reconstruct past weather and climate.\n- **CDS API** (Copernicus Climate Data Store) provides access to ERA5 data via Python scripts, allowing customization of **grid resolution**, **spatial area**, and **output format**.\n\n\n- **Grid Resolution**: Adjust the spatial resolution of the output data (e.g., 1°×1° for coarser regional analysis).\n- **Area Selection**: Define a sub-region using `[North, West, South, East]` coordinates (e.g., Europe: `60., -11., 34., 35.`).\n- **Format**: Choose **NetCDF** for structured data (e.g., `format='netcdf'`).\n- **Variables**: Specify variables like temperature, pressure levels, etc.\n\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport cdsapi\n\nc = cdsapi.Client()\n\nc.retrieve(\n    'reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels',\n    {\n        'product_type': 'reanalysis',\n        'variable': 'temperature',\n        'pressure_level': '1000',  # Example: 1000 hPa pressure level\n        'year': '2021',\n        'month': '01',\n        'day': '01',\n        'time': '12:00',\n        'format': 'netcdf',\n        'area': [60., -11., 34., 35.],  # Europe\n        'grid': [1.0, 1.0],            # 1°×1° resolution\n    },\n    'output/ERAtest_subarea_1deg1deg.nc'\n)\n```\n- **Output**: A NetCDF file (`ERAtest_subarea_1deg1deg.nc`) with 1°×1° resolution over Europe.\n\n\n- **NetCDF** is a standard for scientific data, storing multidimensional arrays (e.g., temperature, pressure) with metadata (e.g., units, coordinates).\n- **Tools** like **NCO** (NetCDF Operators) or **CDO** (Climate Data Operators) can process NetCDF files for analysis (e.g., averaging, filtering).\n\n\n- **Models vs. Observations**: ERA5 is a **reanalysis** (model + observations), not a forecast. It reflects the best estimate of past conditions but is still subject to model biases and uncertainties.\n- **Resolution Trade-offs**: Higher resolution (e.g., 0.1°) improves detail but increases computational cost. Coarser grids (e.g., 1°) are suitable for regional studies or reducing storage.\n\n\n- **NCO/CDO**: Use commands like `ncks` (subset data) or `cdo",

For any given query point $\\\\vec{x}_0$, the necessary correction is calcuated as a weighted sum of contributions from the available samples $x_i$. The big question is what values should the weight corresponding to each sample have? Answering this question is not easy - it is basically the whole point of kriging. The answer will depend on any additional constraints that one applies on these weights and on any additional properties one wishes the field $F$ or $D$ to have (stationarity of various moments, isotropy, etc.). Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}, {'id': 1753903968314666, 'score': 0.6282991, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_7_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"One can then use the arrays **X** and **Y** to directly evaluate functions over the entire grid, for example.\\n\\n**Note**: When working with model output, you may see that the latitudes an longitudes may be supplied either as vectors (**x,y**) or as two arrays (**X,Y**).

This is not the case in scattered datasets where there is no obvious connection between the i$^{th}$ data point and the i$^{th}$+1 or i$^{th}$-1 sample.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page.

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753902702944729, 'score': 0.7143383, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_9', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'task.

The users than then simply download the maps, graph or secondary data without needing to incur the costs associated with storing and maintaining the large climate data archive locally, nor is it required to invest in a powerful computer. \\n\\n\\nThe Toolbox works hand-in-hand with the CDS API. \\n\\nThat is, one can issue commmands to the Toolbox via the CDS API, or develop a python script that does certain things, and then use the CDS API functionality to send it to CDS for evaluation, only to download the finished product locally. \\n\\nExamples of how to proceed are given [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/COPSRV/Call+a+service+with+the+CDS+API). \\n\\nNote, it is also possible to use the CDS Toolbox to plot data from other services (i.e. not originally stored on CDS), using the `remote` function instead of the `service` function. This is possible thanks to protocols such as OPeNDAP. Here is an example using data from UNIDATA. \\n\\nFor illustration of how the Toolbox can be used, the following piece of code, run locally, after the CDS API is properly configured and assuming one is connected to the internet, will produce, and then download to our `output/` directory, a map of global temperature on January 1st 2021 at 14:00.', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 43}}]",

NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\\n\\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \\n\\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\\n\\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable.

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902300206271, 'score': 0.62604654, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_0', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'Climate models –what are they?\\n…and different grids for different parts of the model:atmosphere, ocean, land, ice,…\\n\\nA bit of review: What do we need to make a model?(Any model, not necessarily a climate one)\\nWhat does a model need?A very simple analytical exampledCdt=λRequires equations (hypotheses about underlying physics)\\nWhat does a model need?A very simple analytical exampledCdt=λdCCoCf∫=λdttotf∫Cf=λtf−to()−CoRequires initial &boundary conditionsRequires equations (hypotheses about underlyi', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 0}}]",

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753902703226725, 'score': 0.62471616, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_13', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' model do it all?Processes operate on various time/space scales\\nHigher resolution•(more data)•(local extremes)•(shorter simulation)•(no/few ensembles)Lower resolution•(fewer data)•(longer simulation)•(many ensembles)\\n\\nTake home messages•Models will always be imperfect (accept this!)–the challenge is to make them useful by keeping them as simple as possible in spite oftheir limitations •very difficult in practice, requires deep scientific knowledge•Understanding of the question and of the tools a', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf', 'chunk_number': 13}}, {'id': 1753902702794239, 'score': 0.62385714, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_8', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'cool and warm the climateThe microphysics responsible for cloud formation is not well understoodThe grid cells in models are much much bigger than time/space scales relevant for cloud physicsÞMagnitude/location of rain events is hard to predict wellÞThat information is useful though!\\nComparing models with data•What is a data point?

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753903424509295, 'score': 0.6682389, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 01- Introduction to climate data and climate models\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n## Contents\\n- [Lectures](#lectures)\\n- [Question](#question)\\n- [ESMValTool](#ESMValTool)\\n- [Sources of climate data](#climatedata)\\n- [CEDA](#CEDA)\\n- [File formats](#fileformat)\\n- [Metadata](#metadata)\\n- [NetCDF](#NetCDF)\\n- [NCO](#NCO)\\n- [Reanalysis products](#reanalysis)\\n- [Climate services UKCP18](#ukcp18)\\n  \\n## Learning outcomes\\n1.

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424143550, 'score': 0.64737123, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_11_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='NetCDF'></a>\\n\\n## Network Common Data Form (NetCDF)\\n\\n[NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) is one of the most common data format used to store climate data.

A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable.

    "response": "The provided contexts span topics in **time series analysis**, **spatial statistics**, and **model evaluation**, with a focus on **climate data** and **uncertainty characterization**. Here's a synthesis of key insights:\n\n\n- **Synthetic Data Creation**: Examples include generating stationary and non-stationary time series (e.g., random walks with seasonal cycles) to test statistical methods.\n- **Stationarity Testing**: Tools like the **Zivot-Andrews test** are used to detect structural breaks or non-stationarity. However, results depend on signal-to-noise ratios—weak signals (e.g., periodic components) may be obscured by noise, complicating interpretation.\n- **Detrending Challenges**: Non-stationary data (e.g., with seasonal cycles) requires careful detrending, but tests may fail to detect non-stationarity if the signal is too faint relative to noise.\n\n\n- **Kriging**: A geostatistical method (also called \"objective mapping\") that models spatial correlations using a **Gauss-Markov process**. It relies on covariance matrices to quantify how neighboring points influence each other.\n- **Spatial Covariance**: Similar to time series autocorrelation, spatial points $(x_i, y_i)$ are assumed to have correlated values, with the degree of correlation defined by a covariance function.\n\n\n- **Model Limitations**: All models are inherently imperfect. The challenge is to balance **simplicity** (e.g., using low-resolution models for broad trends) with **accuracy** (e.g., high-resolution models for local extremes).\n- **Ensemble Simulations**: Running multiple ensemble simulations (e.g., 100+ runs) helps quantify uncertainties. Averaged results (e.g., surface temperature anomalies) can reveal patterns despite individual model biases.\n- **Probabilistic Answers**: Accept that models may not perfectly capture all variables. For example, a model might reproduce the **mean state** well but fail to capture **variability**, requiring probabilistic interpretations.\n\n\n- **Resolution vs. Data**: Higher-resolution models require more data, shorter simulations, and fewer ensembles. Lower-resolution models use less data but can run longer simulations with more ensembles.\n- **Model Selection**: Choose the simplest model that suffices for the task. For instance,",

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}]",

If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point.

The answer will depend on any additional constraints that one applies on these weights and on any additional properties one wishes the field $F$ or $D$ to have (stationarity of various moments, isotropy, etc.). Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}, {'id': 1753903968046490, 'score': 0.60432506, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_22_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '### Krigging (a.k.a objective mapping, a.k.a Gauss-Markov regression)\\n\\nKriging takes many names, depending on the field of study.

    "response": "The relationship between **models** and **observations** is central to scientific modeling, particularly in fields like meteorology, oceanography, and climate science. Here's a structured breakdown of key concepts from the provided context:\n\n\n- **Models** are theoretical frameworks that simulate physical processes (e.g., atmospheric dynamics, ocean currents) using mathematical equations. They generate predictions but are inherently limited by simplifications and uncertainties.\n- **Observations** are empirical data collected from instruments (e.g., satellites, buoys, weather stations) that provide direct measurements of the real world. They are critical for validating models and improving their accuracy.\n\n**Key distinction**:  \n- Pure **models** (e.g., climate models) are theoretical constructs.  \n- Pure **observations** are raw data without model interpretation.  \n- **Reanalysis products** combine both: models assimilated with observational data to create a consistent, dynamically coherent dataset (e.g., ERA5, NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis).\n\n\n- **Data assimilation** integrates observational data into models to improve their accuracy. Techniques like **4DVAR** (Four-Dimensional Variational Assimilation) adjust model states iteratively to minimize discrepancies between forecasts and observations.\n- **Reanalysis products** (e.g., \"Reanalysis\" in the context of weather forecasting) use historical observations to \"replay\" models over time, creating a unified dataset that bridges gaps in observational coverage.\n\n**Example**:  \n- The **Climate.be textbook** (linked in the context) emphasizes the role of **Observational System Simulation Experiments (OSSE)**, which simulate how models would perform with hypothetical observational networks. This helps evaluate model strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\n- **Model-observation mismatch**: Models may not capture all physical processes (e.g., cloud microphysics, ocean eddies), while observations are often sparse or noisy.  \n- **OSSE and validation**: OSSE experiments test how well models can reproduce observed patterns, guiding improvements in both models and observational strategies.  \n- **Spatial and temporal resolution**: High-resolution models require dense observational networks, which are often limited by cost or technology.\n\n\n- **Kriging** (spatial interpolation) and **objective mapping** (used in oceanography) are tools for estimating values at unobserved locations by leveraging spatial correlations. These methods are often part of data assimilation workflows.  \n- **Code examples** (e.g.,",

Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\\n\\nYou\\'ll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \\n\\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \\n\\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \\n\\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\\n\\n## This segment of the module\\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\\n\\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \\nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \\nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\\n\\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\\n\\n\\n## We will focus and use climate data.\\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \\n\\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \\n___', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 0}}, {'id': 1753903968314666, 'score': 0.60689014, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_7_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"One can then use the arrays **X** and **Y** to directly evaluate functions over the entire grid, for example.\\n\\n**Note**: When working with model output, you may see that the latitudes an longitudes may be supplied either as vectors (**x,y**) or as two arrays (**X,Y**).

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}]",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753901956989969, 'score': 0.69015825, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_2', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g.calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).Learning objectives of the Environmental Data module•Growing/important field –with likely career opportunities•Great playground to deliver learning objectives\\nUsing climate models: quantification/forecasting(impacts, adaptation, mitigation)\\nhttps://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts\\nUsing climate models: designscenarios(explore policy,', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf', 'chunk_number': 2}}, {'id': 1753903424228032, 'score': 0.68845457, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_43_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '### The CDS Toolbox\\n\\nAn extention to the CDS API is the [CDS Toolbox](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/toolbox/doc/index.html).

The Toolbox allows users to develop python scripts for the CDS and to run them online.

These entries appear to be fragments of documents or notes related to **climate data analysis**, **reanalysis products**, and **tools for accessing climate data** (e.g., CDS API, CDS Toolbox). Here's a structured breakdown of the key themes and how to approach them:\n\n\n\n- **Definition**: Reanalysis products (like ERA5) combine model simulations with observational data to create a consistent, dynamically interpolated dataset. They are not direct observations but model outputs adjusted to match observations.\n- **Key Points**:\n  - **Grid Geometry**: ERA5 data in NetCDF format is interpolated to a regular lat/lon grid, while GRIB format retains the model's native grid (non-regular).\n  - **Wrap-Around Issue**: Longitudes are on a [0°, 360°] grid, requiring care to handle the wrap-around (e.g., 0° and 360° are the same point).\n  - **Use Cases**: Ideal for global spatial/temporal analysis but not a substitute for raw observations.\n\n- **CDS API & Toolbox**:\n  - **CDS API**: A Python interface to access Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) data.\n  - **CDS Toolbox**: Extends the API, allowing users to run scripts online, avoid local storage, and download results.\n  - **Example**: Code to fetch and plot global temperature data from ERA5 using the Toolbox.\n- **Remote Data Access**: Tools like OPeNDAP enable accessing data from external services (e.g., UNIDATA) via the Toolbox.\n\n- **Model vs. Observations**:\n  - Models (e.g., reanalysis products) assimilate observational data to improve accuracy.\n  - Challenges include **data assimilation techniques** (e.g., 4D-Var) and **model limitations** (e.g., grid resolution, physics approximations).\n- **Common Issues**:\n  - **Cloud Physics**: Models struggle with small-scale processes (e.g., cloud formation).\n  - **Observational vs. Model Data**: Comparing model outputs to observations requires careful spatial/temporal alignment.\n\n- **Data Formats**: NetCDF vs. GRIB (interpolation, grid geometry).\n- **Software Tools**: Python scripts, CDS Toolbox, and Numpy/Pandas for data manipulation.\n- **Grid Handling**: Addressing longitude wrap-around in datasets.\n\n\n\n- Are they looking to **access ERA5 data**?  \n- Need help with **data assimilation concepts**?  \n- Want to **use the CDS Toolbox** for analysis?  \n- Or are they seeking a **summary of climate data challenges**?\n\n- **For ERA5 Users**: Focus on grid geometry, interpolation, and handling longitude wrap-around.\n- **For CDS",

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \\n\\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe (\\'18\\' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \\n\\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that\\'s a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \\n\\nAlthough UKCP18 is \\'just\\' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\\n\\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\\n\\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn\\'t contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \\n\\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\\n\\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \\n\\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\\n\\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \\nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \\n\\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \\n\\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \\n\\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \\n\\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\\n3. Output: Data only\\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\\n   \\nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \\n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \\n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \\n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \\n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can\\'t differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \\n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that\\'s a lot of data!).\\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \\n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \\n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \\n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don\\'t close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \\n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \\n\\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\\n\\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \\n\\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we\\'ll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\\n\\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 46}}, {'id': 1753901957273136, 'score': 0.6158087, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_6', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'now –probably lots of good opportunities in that sector!\\n\\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00984-6Fiedler et al. 2021 advocate for a reorganization of climate science highlighting the need for climate projection to be professionalized as an operational service (b)Climate services\\ni.e.the way the field of climate science works will evolve in the next few years\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf', 'chunk_number': 6}}, {'id': 1753902702850873, 'score': 0.6118051, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_7', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'lot!Radiative-convective equilibrium\\n\\nThe hydrologic cycle challenge and Relative humidity (h)•It is the ratio of partial pressure of water vapor to the equilibrium partial pressure–“the salinity of the atmosphere”•Relative humidity decreases as T increases–Warm air can hold more water•More water = more clouds?•More low clouds = more albedo?•More high clouds = more greenhouse?–Question: If T increases and air can hold more water, what happens over deserts?\\nThe “clouds” challenge\\nClouds can both ', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf', 'chunk_number': 7}}, {'id': 1753903424262111, 'score': 0.608692, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_38_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='reanalysis'></a>\\n\\n# Reanalysis products\\n\\n![C3S](img/c3s-logo.png)\\n![ECMWF](img/logo-ecmwf.png) \\n\\n[*ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables.

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}]",

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities.

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \\n\\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe (\\'18\\' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \\n\\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that\\'s a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \\n\\nAlthough UKCP18 is \\'just\\' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\\n\\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\\n\\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn\\'t contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \\n\\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\\n\\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \\n\\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\\n\\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \\nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \\n\\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \\n\\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \\n\\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \\n\\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\\n3. Output: Data only\\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\\n   \\nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \\n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \\n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \\n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \\n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can\\'t differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \\n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that\\'s a lot of data!).\\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \\n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \\n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \\n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don\\'t close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \\n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \\n\\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\\n\\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \\n\\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we\\'ll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\\n\\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 46}}, {'id': 1753903424143550, 'score': 0.63450795, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_11_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='NetCDF'></a>\\n\\n## Network Common Data Form (NetCDF)\\n\\n[NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) is one of the most common data format used to store climate data.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

This series may be ordered in space (e.g. down a stratigraphic section) or in time (e.g. over the past 100 years). In either case, these are known as `time series`, and the term `time-series analysis` is used to describe the application of quantitative methods to discover patterns in the data. \\n\\nThe series variable can be defined either by a rank-order or by a quantitative measure of position along the series axis (time or space). To illustrate this, consider a tree rings.  A rank-order series is defined by the order that the rings appear, from inside to outside: first, second, third, ..., last.  A quantitative sequence measure, on the other hand, can be defined if each ring is dated, with ages: $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$, ..., $t_N$. (For tree rings, this is easy as one ring = one year.)\\n\\nA time-series consists of an observation at each entry in the rank-order or measured-time list.  This measurement can also be qualitative or quantitative.  As an example of the former, we might have a record of the presence or absence of a certain fossil-type in each layer of the stratigraphic sequence. The latter type of time-series, composed of quantitative observations, might be the height of water in a lake, the lateral displacement of a GPS station, or, in the case of tree rings, maybe the mass-fraction of a pollutant in the wood.\\n\\n[Time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series) data can be equally spaced or not, but if not, then extra care must be taken to analyze them. Time-series refer to sequence of discrete in time data. This also means that the points have a relationship with one-another, i.e some points cannot exist before, or after other points. That organization, containted in the order, can be exploited to learn more about real-world processes. \\n\\nData where time (or rank order, or sequential order) doesn't matter are sometimes called `cross sectional data`. These are sets of data observed at a single time, or where time has no meaning. \\n\\nTypically, time series data have the following form: \\n1. a time or index variable, or (when unlucky), multiple columns that have to be combined to create a meaningful time variable (this is often the case, when year, month, day, time, etc. are in different columns)\\n2. other columns of data with measurements/values of interest.\\n\\nNote that datasets can of course also contain [both cross-sectional and time series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsroWpkUuYI) information, in which case analysis can be performed for each time step, and across time steps, yielding for very rich analysis. For example, we could have data that measure the temporal evolution of some environmental variables in various locations. One could therefore compare locations spatially, at each time point, look at the evolution of the data at each station, and also do both. That is, time series analysis may not necessarily only concern 1D datasets, but also 2D, 3D, or ND datasets. \\n\\nIn general, we will consider time-series composed of $N$ entries indexed by an integer $i$ that goes from 1 to $N$.  For each value of $i$ we will have a measure of the position (e.g.~time), $t_i$, and a measure of some quantity at that time, $q_i$.  Hence a general time-series can be represented as\\n$\\n  t_1,\\\\, t_2,\\\\, t_3,\\\\,...,\\\\,t_{N-1},\\\\,t_N; \\\\\\\\\\n  q_1,\\\\, q_2,\\\\, q_3,\\\\,...,\\\\,q_{N-1},\\\\,q_N.\\n$\\n\\nA primary consideration in analysing a time-series is whether its entries are `regularly spaced`.  Regular spacing means that there is a constant difference between $t_{i+1}$ and $t_i$:\\n\\n$\\n  t_{i+1} - t_i = \\\\Delta t\\\\text{, const. for all }i.\\n$\\n\\nThe spacing between successive measurements, $\\\\Delta t$, could be a microsecond, or a metre, or a million years; the important point is that the same spacing applies to any pair of consecutive entries in the series.\\n\\nIf $\\\\Delta t$ is not constant, then interpolation methods can be used to interpolate the original data onto a constant grid, with constant spacing. \\n\\nThere are many ways to interpolate data, but not one best way. It is up to the analyst to pick the 'best' way and this will depend on the data distribution, data type, and on the research objectives. It is hard to know a-priori what works best for a given case and the analyst will need to check that her/his choice will not critically affect the conclusion of the study. \\n\\n`Linear interpolation` is often an excellent first choice. It is simple and fast. However, because it relies on simply interpolating [between neighboring points using strait line segments](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter17.02-Linear-Interpolation.html), the interpolated product could be 'jagged'. Depending on the smoothness of the true process sampled by the time series, `higher-order polynomials` or `splines` could be used, or, as discuss later, a `loess/lowess` fit. \\n\\nPython provides many functions for **interpolation**, for instance from `scipy.interpolate`, such as [`interp1d`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.interp1d.html), [`interp2d`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.interp2d.html#scipy.interpolate.interp2d) for 2D grids for linear and bilinear interpolation, or [`UnivariateSpline`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline.html#scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline) or [`BivariateSpline`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.BivariateSpline.html#scipy.interpolate.BivariateSpline) for smoother options.

A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\\n\\n\\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)). [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu) also manages [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu), one of the first center to have developped climate models and is today one of the gold-standard on the topic. \\n\\nNCAR also developed [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu), an interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization (we will not use NCL here, but the python package `ESMValTool` has build-in support for it). \\n\\n[NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu) has also developped the [climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu), a tool to search and access >200 data sets specific to the ocean, land and the atmosphere.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903424959234, 'score': 0.61290467, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_9_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '<a id=\\'Metadata\\'></a>\\n\\n## The importance of Metadata\\n[Metadata](https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/4428-metadata-basics) **relate to all the information necessary to interpret, understand and use a given dataset. Metadata are not the data themselves, but are required to provide context and therefore inform the data analysis.** \\n\\nThere are two types of metadata, \"**discover metadata**\", which can be used to locate the dataset in a search, and \"**detailed metadata**\", which contain the information necessary to use the data (ideally) without having to ask the data provider for more information (even if one of the key piece of information should be the data provider information and contact detail!).\\n\\nThere is no upper limit as to what information should be included in the metadata, but typical metadata comprise information about when and where the observations, or the file, where produced, how they were produced (which instrument, technique, algorithm were used), information about the experiment the data come from, maybe some information about data accuracy (if not provided as seperate data in the file), information about who produced the data or the file, including contact information, or appropriate reference(s), and, if relevant, additional information about the research context, i.e. which project is associated with these data (this could help the user understand if more data from this group/project exist or can be expected). If the data represent a subset of a larger dataset, this should also be mentioned. \\n\\nAnother key pieces of information that the metadata should provide are a description of the variables in the file, with variable **names**, and the **units** of these variables. \\n\\nIf the data in the file represent a processed version of other raw data, then one should add information about these raw data as well, their provenance, references, and the transformation that was made, etc. One should be able to track the chain of information all the way to the orginal observations (or model output). \\n\\nIf the data represent gridded variables, then the nature of the grid on which these data are defined should also be explained. \\n\\nSimilarly, if the position, or some other features of the data, depend on a reference system, that reference system should be given. This will be discussed in more depth during the introduction to geostatistics lecture. \\n\\nIn the case of climate models (or other models, if relevant), the metadata should also include information about the model itself, the model name, version, the length of the integration, maybe a brief description of the spin-up, boundary conditions, initial conditions used to produce the simulation. \\n\\nObviously the information that will be included in the metadata vary substantially. You should learn (and will discover - mostly through shear frustration when key information is missing!) what constitute useful metadata in your field of work. \\n\\nMetadata can be included in the file itself (if the file format allows it), as separate files, or in the form of some other documents. When sourcing data, always make a note of where the data come from. This is especially true if getting data online as it is very easy to download data and then forget where they come from. Detailed note-taking is part of the job of the data analyst (and that of any scientist!). \\n\\nWhen metadata is included in the file directly, this typically comes as a header, or in a specified location in the file. The netCDF format has rules for how/where to include metadata, which is one of the reason why netCDF data are particularly useful and popular in climate science. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 9}}, {'id': 1753902703274403, 'score': 0.60859513, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_4', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'solving dynamical equations–Smaller discretization steps•Better representation of topography/bathymetry (mountains, islands, seamounts…)–Grid-boxes have vertical walls (depends on coordinate system)•Explicit inclusion of subgrid-scale processes–Parameterizing vs. resolving (e.g.eddies, overflows, etc)•Property gradients can be larger –Affects pressure gradients (i.e.velocity of currents)–Model becomes more advective and less diffusive, maybe more turbulent–Exchange-processes that depend on gradi', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf', 'chunk_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753902702794239, 'score': 0.60661894, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_8', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'cool and warm the climateThe microphysics responsible for cloud formation is not well understoodThe grid cells in models are much much bigger than time/space scales relevant for cloud physicsÞMagnitude/location of rain events is hard to predict wellÞThat information is useful though!\\nComparing models with data•What is a data point?

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}]"

    "response": "The provided context discusses key aspects of climate modeling, data handling, and tools used in environmental science. Here's a structured summary of the main points:\n\n\n- **Nature of Models**: Climate models are simplified representations of Earth's systems (atmosphere, oceans, land, ice) and rely on equations to simulate physical processes. They are inherently incomplete and \"wrong\" due to uncertainties in parameterization, unresolved scales, and unquantified feedbacks (e.g., the effect of \"Z\" on climate).\n- **Challenges**:\n  - **Resolution**: Coarse grids may miss small-scale processes (e.g., cloud dynamics).\n  - **Parameterization**: Complex processes (e.g., turbulence, phase changes) are approximated with empirical formulas.\n  - **Data Assimilation**: Models must be validated against observations, but real-world data is limited to one Earth realization, complicating comparisons.\n\n\n- **Observational Role**: Observations are critical for validating models and identifying biases. Techniques like **Observational System Simulation Experiments (OSSE)** and **data assimilation** (e.g., 4DVAR) help bridge the gap between models and reality.\n- **Reanalysis Products**: These combine models with observational data to produce consistent, long-term datasets (e.g., for weather forecasting and climate studies).\n\n\n- **ESMValTool**: \n  - A Python-based tool for diagnosing and analyzing climate models, supporting large datasets and HPC systems.\n  - Integrates with the **Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)** for data access.\n  - Capabilities include data manipulation, visualization, and bias detection.\n  - **Optional Installation**: Requires Python 3.7+ and tools like `mamba` (dependency manager). Not mandatory for basic tasks but valuable for advanced research.\n\n- **Python Environments**: \n  - Emphasizes the use of Python 3 for climate data analysis, with tools like `xarray`, `netCDF4`, and `matplotlib` commonly used.\n  - Encourages setting up dedicated environments for reproducibility and scalability.\n\n\n- **Data Handling**: Requires familiarity with formats (e.g., NetCDF, HDF5) and large datasets, often managed via distributed computing.\n- **Model Evaluation**: Comparing models to observations is essential for improving accuracy and understanding uncertainties.\n- **Community Resources**: Tools like ESMValTool and repositories like ESGF are vital for collaborative, large-scale climate research.\n\n\n- Climate models are indispensable but inherently approximate, requiring continuous refinement.\n- Observations and data assimilation are critical for model validation and improving predictive accuracy.\n- Tools like ESMValTool and Python-based workflows enable efficient analysis of complex climate datasets, fostering advancements in environmental science.\n\nIf you have a specific question about any of these topics, feel free to ask!",

More sophisticated methods would be preferred. The `model` option of `seasonal_decompose` can be either additive or multiplicative. This refers to:\\n\\nAdditive model: Y[t] = T[t] + S[t] + e[t]\\n\\nMultiplicative model: Y[t] = T[t] * S[t] * e[t]\\n\\nThe results are obtained by first estimating the trend (T[t]) by applying a convolution filter to the data. The trend is then removed from the series and the average of this de-trended series for each period is the returned seasonal component.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the random walk, the random walk data with added periodicity just created above and also to a new case, with a long-term trend added.    \\n\\nYou are encourage to explore the tools offered by 'statsmodels' on your own. \", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_timeseriesanalysis-IC-X9CYXD36RX.ipynb', 'cell_number': 15}}, {'id': 1753905536631108, 'score': 0.6174688, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_timeseriesanalysis.ipynb_cell_22_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"Looking at the result, we see:\\n1.

NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\\n\\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \\n\\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\\n\\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\\n\\n\\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)).

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753902702794239, 'score': 0.6248779, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_8', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'cool and warm the climateThe microphysics responsible for cloud formation is not well understoodThe grid cells in models are much much bigger than time/space scales relevant for cloud physicsÞMagnitude/location of rain events is hard to predict wellÞThat information is useful though!\\nComparing models with data•What is a data point?

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \\n\\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe (\\'18\\' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \\n\\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that\\'s a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \\n\\nAlthough UKCP18 is \\'just\\' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\\n\\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\\n\\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn\\'t contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \\n\\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\\n\\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \\n\\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\\n\\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \\nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \\n\\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \\n\\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \\n\\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \\n\\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\\n3. Output: Data only\\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\\n   \\nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \\n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \\n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \\n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \\n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can\\'t differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \\n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that\\'s a lot of data!).\\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \\n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \\n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \\n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don\\'t close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \\n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \\n\\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\\n\\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \\n\\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we\\'ll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\\n\\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 46}}, {'id': 1753902702662417, 'score': 0.65853304, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_10', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ls that are ‘fitted’ to data•Some model parameters are tuned to fit–Question is what to fit/how?

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903967981470, 'score': 0.6292854, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_0_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 03 Environmental Data: Thinking spatially\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n* ## Contents\\n- [Spatial data](#spatial)\\n- [Surface interpolation](#surface)\\n- [Gridded data](#gridded)\\n- [Scattered data](#scattered)\\n- [Surface fitting](#fitting)\\n- [Plotting and manipulating spatial data](#plotting)\\n- [Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)](#crs)\\n- [Geopandas](#geopandas)\\n- [Cartopy](#cartopy)\\n- [A nicer example](#example)\\n  \\n* ## Learning outcomes\\n1.

If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\\n\\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \\n\\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement. The contoured estimate will tend to either over or underestimate the true value, within a tolerance controlled by the noise associated with the measurements. \\n\\nThe shape of the fitted surface will depend strongly on the data available: their locations, their uncertainties, as well as subjective choices made during the analysis (i.e. definition of the so-called 'covariance matrix').\\n\\nWe will here look at a technique called **kriging**, pioneered by a South African mining engineer called Danie G.

Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\\n\\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \\n\\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\\n1.

It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$.

Beyond this distance, spatial correlation is negligible.\n3. **Nugget ($n$)**: Accounts for micro-scale variability or measurement error. It represents the value of the semivariogram at $h = 0$ (before the model starts).\n\n- For $h \\le a$, the semivariogram increases nonlinearly, reflecting the gradual loss of spatial correlation.\n- For $h > a$, the semivariogram plateaus at the sill, indicating no further correlation.\n\nThis model is ideal for data where spatial correlation diminishes smoothly with distance, such as soil properties or environmental measurements.

    "response": "1. **Grid Resolution and Discretization**:\n   - **Spatial Resolution**: Higher resolution improves representation of topography (mountains, islands) and bathymetry (seamounts), but increases computational demands. Lower resolution may oversimplify features.\n   - **Integration Time Step**: Smaller steps improve accuracy but require more computational resources.\n   - **Grid Structure**: Grid-boxes often have vertical walls, depending on the coordinate system (e.g., latitude-longitude vs. sigma coordinates).\n\n2. **Subgrid-Scale Processes**:\n   - **Parameterization vs. Resolution**: Processes like eddies, overflows, and cloud microphysics are either resolved (explicitly modeled) or parameterized (approximated using equations). Parameterization introduces uncertainties but is necessary for computational efficiency.\n   - **Impact on Dynamics**: Subgrid-scale processes affect pressure gradients, velocity of currents, and turbulence. For example, unresolved cloud physics leads to challenges in predicting rain events.\n\n3. **Coupling Mechanisms**:\n   - **Ocean-Atmosphere Interaction**: Climate models integrate ocean and atmosphere through a \"coupler,\" which manages exchanges of heat, momentum, and moisture. This coupling is critical for simulating climate feedbacks (e.g., El Niño, monsoons).\n\n4. **Model Output Handling**:\n   - **Data Formats**: Model outputs are often provided as 2D grids (**X, Y**) rather than vectors, especially for irregular grids. This allows evaluation of functions over the entire grid.\n   - **Spatial-Temporal Analysis**: Tools like `np.meshgrid` and `cartopy` help visualize and analyze model data, incorporating features like coastlines, rivers, and land/ocean boundaries.\n\n\n1. **Resolution vs. Computational Cost**:\n   - **High Resolution**: Captures local extremes and small-scale features but requires more data, shorter simulations, and fewer ensembles.\n   - **Low Resolution**: Reduces computational load but may miss critical dynamics (e.g., cloud physics, coastal processes).\n\n2. **Model Imperfections**:\n   - **Inherent Limitations**: Models cannot perfectly represent all physical processes (e.g., unresolved cloud microphysics). The goal is to balance simplicity with utility, avoiding overfitting to specific variables.\n   - **Probabilistic Interpretation**: Accept that models may consistently offset results or reproduce means well but variability poorly. Probabilistic approaches are often necessary.\n\n3. **Uncertainty Sources**:\n   - **Numerical Methods**: Choices of equations, discretization, and time steps affect",

    "response": "The provided code and markdown content illustrate key concepts in the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), particularly the **symmetry of the DFT output** and the **Nyquist frequency**. Here's a breakdown of the key ideas and their implementation:\n\n\n- **DFT Symmetry**: For real-valued signals (like sine waves), the DFT output is **conjugate symmetric**. This means the second half of the spectrum (above the Nyquist frequency) is a mirror image of the first half. Only the first half (up to the Nyquist frequency) contains unique information.\n- **Nyquist Frequency**: This is **half the sampling rate** (e.g., 50 Hz for a 100 Hz sampling rate). It represents the **maximum frequency** that can be accurately captured without aliasing. Frequencies above this are \"folded\" into the lower range, causing distortion.\n\n\n\n- The code generates sine waves at specific frequencies (e.g., 5 Hz, 10 Hz, 1 Hz, 4 Hz, 7 Hz) and combines them into a composite signal.\n- Example:\n  ```python\n  freq = 1.0\n  x = 3 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * freq * t)\n  freq = 4.0\n  x += np.sin(2 * np.pi * freq * t)\n  ```\n  This creates a signal with multiple frequency components.\n\n- A custom DFT function (not shown) computes the frequency spectrum. The result is normalized by dividing by the number of samples (`N`) to scale amplitudes correctly.\n- The code then extracts the **positive frequency components** (up to Nyquist) and plots them.\n\n- The DFT output is plotted using `stem()` to highlight discrete frequency bins.\n- The first half of the spectrum (up to Nyquist) shows the actual frequency components, while the second half is redundant due to symmetry",

    "response": "The provided text highlights key challenges and considerations in the use of climate models, emphasizing their imperfections while underscoring their utility when applied thoughtfully. Here's a structured summary of the core ideas:\n\n\n- **Numerical and Structural Issues**: \n  - Models rely on approximations (e.g., parameterizations for complex processes like cloud formation) and numerical schemes that can introduce errors (e.g., numerical diffusion).\n  - Resolution trade-offs: Higher resolution captures local extremes but requires more computational resources and fewer ensembles, while lower resolution may miss short-term dynamics but allows longer simulations.\n- **Uncertainties in Inputs**: \n  - Boundary conditions, forcing data (e.g., greenhouse gas concentrations), and initial states introduce uncertainties.\n  - Internal variability (natural climate fluctuations) complicates distinguishing \"forced\" responses (e.g., warming due to CO₂) from natural variability.\n\n\n- **Embrace Probabilistic Answers**: \n  - Models are inherently imperfect, but their value lies in providing probabilistic insights rather than deterministic predictions.\n  - Ensemble simulations (e.g., 100+ runs) help quantify uncertainties and improve confidence in aggregated results.\n- **Simplicity vs. Complexity**: \n  - \"If simple works, go simple!\" (e.g., using reduced-complexity models for specific questions) avoids overfitting and reduces data processing demands.\n  - Overly complex models may not add value if the question doesn’t require high-resolution details.\n\n\n- **Tailoring to Specific Questions**: \n  - Models are most useful when aligned with the analysis goal (e.g., regional climate impacts vs. global trends).\n  - For example, a model might excel at reproducing mean temperature but struggle with variability, requiring careful interpretation.\n- **Skill of the Analyst**: \n  - The analyst’s role is critical: selecting the right model, interpreting outputs within uncertainty bounds, and avoiding overreach (e.g., attributing trends to specific factors without proper evidence).\n  - Spectral analysis (e.g., autocorrelation functions) must account for trends or seasonal signals to avoid misleading conclusions.\n\n\n- **Models Are Tools, Not Perfect Predictors**: \n  - They are not \"right\" in an absolute sense but provide structured, testable hypotheses about climate behavior.\n- **Balance Trade-offs**: \n  - Higher resolution may improve local accuracy but requires computational trade-offs; lower resolution allows longer simulations and ensemble analysis.\n- **Uncertainty as a Feature, Not a Flaw**: \n  - Acknowledging uncertainties (numerical, parametric, or observational) is essential for robust analysis and decision-making.\n\n\nClimate models are indispensable despite their imperfections. Their utility lies in their ability to simulate complex systems, quantify uncertainties, and guide policy and research when applied with scientific rigor. The challenge is to use them judiciously, recognizing their limitations while leveraging their strengths for specific questions. As the text emphasizes, the goal is not to achieve \"perfection\" but to make models as useful as possible within their constraints.",

    "response": "To address your query about climate data analysis, model performance, and ensemble simulations, here's a structured overview based on the provided contexts:\n\n\n- **Imperfections and Simplicity**: Models are inherently imperfect, but their utility lies in balancing simplicity with scientific accuracy. The goal is to keep models as simple as possible while addressing key processes, even if they have limitations (e.g., unresolved cloud physics).  \n- **Metrics for Model Selection**:  \n  - **Mean State vs. Variability**: A model might reproduce the mean climate well but fail to capture variability (e.g., extreme weather events). This highlights the need for metrics that evaluate both statistical averages and dynamic patterns.  \n  - **Probabilistic Answers**: Accept that models may not always provide deterministic results. Instead, use probabilistic frameworks to quantify uncertainties (e.g., multi-model ensembles).  \n  - **Data Assimilation**: Reanalysis products (e.g., 4DVAR) combine models with observational data to improve accuracy, especially for short-term forecasts or historical reconstructions.\n\n\n- **Ensemble Runs**:  \n  - **Purpose**: Generate 100+ ensemble members to quantify uncertainties in climate projections. This helps distinguish between **internal variability** (natural fluctuations within the climate system, e.g., El Niño) and **forced responses** (changes due to external factors like CO₂ emissions).  \n  - **Averaged Surface Temperature Anomaly**: Ensemble averages reduce noise and highlight long-term trends, while spread among members reflects uncertainty in future projections.  \n- **Internal Variability**:  \n  - Natural climate fluctuations (e.g., ocean cycles) can mask or amplify forced responses. Ensemble simulations help isolate these effects, ensuring that conclusions about climate change are not confounded by natural variability.  \n\n\n- **Key Sources of Uncertainty**:  \n  - **Numerics and Equations**: Discretization methods (e.g., finite differences) and approximations in equations can introduce errors. Testing numerical schemes (e.g., forward vs. backward Euler) is critical.  \n  - **Resolution**: Higher resolution captures smaller-scale processes (e.g., cloud dynamics) but requires more computational resources. Lower resolution may miss critical feedbacks (e.g., ice-albedo effect).  \n  - **Parameterizations**: Simplified representations of complex processes (e.g., convection, aerosol effects) are inherently uncertain. These must be validated against observations.  \n  - **Boundary Conditions and Forcing**: Uncertainties in external drivers (e.g., greenhouse gas concentrations, land-use changes) propagate through models.  \n\n\n- **Process vs. Analysis Goals**:  \n  - **Simple Models**: Use for broad trends (e.g., global warming) or when computational resources are limited.  \n  - **Complex Models**: Required for detailed studies (e.g., regional climate impacts, feedback mechanisms).  \n- **Trade-offs**:  \n  - **Resolution vs. Ensemble Size**: Higher resolution reduces the need for large ensembles but increases computational cost. Conversely, lower resolution may require more ensemble members to capture variability.  \n  - **Data Availability**: Prioritize models that align",
    "reference": "Initial conditions set the model's starting point, while boundary conditions define the limits. Errors or approximations in either can lead to divergent model outputs or misinterpretations, especially in long-term climate projections.",

    "response": "The provided contexts highlight critical aspects of climate science, data analysis, and modeling. Here's a structured summary of key insights and their implications:\n\n\n- **Record Warmth**: 2023 was the warmest year on record, with global near-surface temperatures **1.45°C above pre-industrial levels** (±0.12°C uncertainty). This underscores the urgency of understanding climate trends and model accuracy.\n- **Data Sources**: Reports like the **State of the Climate 2023** integrate observations of greenhouse gases, sea level rise, and ocean heat content. These datasets are vital for validating climate models and tracking long-term trends.\n\n\n- **Resolution Challenges**: \n  - **High-Resolution Models** (e.g., 10 km grid cells) better capture phenomena like ocean eddies (e.g., Gulf Stream) and regional weather patterns. \n  - **Low-Resolution Models** (e.g., 100 km cells) may miss small-scale processes (e.g., cloud physics), leading to uncertainties in predicting rain events or extreme weather.\n- **Microphysics Uncertainty**: Cloud formation and precipitation processes are poorly understood at the grid scale, affecting model predictions of regional climate impacts.\n\n\n- **Climate Data Operators (CDO)**: \n  - A suite of over 600 tools for processing climate data (e.g., GRIB, netCDF). \n  - Enables tasks like calculating climate indices, filtering data, and analyzing model outputs. \n  - **Advantages**: Handles complex data formats and supports ensemble analysis. \n  - **Limitations**: Less efficient than NCO (NCEP Climate Data Operators) for memory-intensive tasks.\n- **CDS API**: \n  - Allows users to download climate data (e.g., ERA5) with customizable resolutions and sub-domains, optimizing computational resources for specific applications.\n\n\n- **Ensemble Experiments**: \n  - Used to quantify uncertainties (e.g., aerosol effects, ocean dynamics) and sensitivity to initial conditions. \n  - Projects like **MIP (Model Intercomparison Project)** standardize experiments to compare model outputs against observations.\n- **Data-Model Comparison**: \n  - Models must align with observational data (spatial/temporal) to validate their predictive power. \n  - Discrepancies (e.g., regional temperature trends) highlight gaps in model physics or resolution.\n\n\n- **Resolution Trade-offs**: Higher resolution improves accuracy but increases computational costs. Balancing resolution with practicality is critical for climate research.\n- **Data Accessibility",

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753902703222464, 'score': 0.68230855, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_12', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'n meanModel performance and deciding which is the best model?Which is the best “Metric” -a judgment call?\\nInternal variability vs “forced” response?Ensemble simulations\\nRun 1, 2, 3 are ‘ensemble’ runsToday, 100s of ensemble runs can be generatedThat’s a lot of data!\\nAveraged surface temperature anomaly\\nWhat model for what process, for what analysis?Choosing the best model product for the jobIf simple works, go simple!

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753903424143550, 'score': 0.6661409, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_11_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='NetCDF'></a>\\n\\n## Network Common Data Form (NetCDF)\\n\\n[NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) is one of the most common data format used to store climate data. NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\\n\\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \\n\\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\\n\\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\\n\\n\\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)). [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu) also manages [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu), one of the first center to have developped climate models and is today one of the gold-standard on the topic. \\n\\nNCAR also developed [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu), an interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization (we will not use NCL here, but the python package `ESMValTool` has build-in support for it). \\n\\n[NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu) has also developped the [climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu), a tool to search and access >200 data sets specific to the ocean, land and the atmosphere.

    "response": "The skill of the analyst in climate science and spatial data analysis lies in **selecting the right model/simulations for the right question**, while **accounting for uncertainties** and **designing meaningful experiments**. Here's a structured approach to address this:\n\n\n- **Key Considerations**:\n  - **Purpose of the Analysis**: Determine whether the question requires high-resolution spatial/temporal data, probabilistic outcomes, or multi-model comparisons (e.g., MIP experiments).\n  - **Model Resolution Trade-offs**: Higher spatial resolution increases computational cost (e.g., 8× more computations for 2× resolution in all dimensions) but improves numerical accuracy. Balance this with the study's goals.\n  - **Parameterizations and Boundary Conditions**: Choose models that accurately represent the physical processes (e.g., cloud dynamics, ocean currents) relevant to the question. Validate against real-world data or multi-model means.\n  - **Uncertainty Quantification**: Use ensemble methods or probabilistic frameworks to account for model errors, parameter uncertainties, and observational limitations. For example, compare models against the multi-model mean to identify strengths and weaknesses.\n\n- **Experimental Design**:\n  - **Controlled Experiments**: Test hypotheses by varying parameters (e.g., CO₂ concentrations, land-use changes) and analyzing outcomes. Use sensitivity analyses to isolate variables.\n  - **Spatial and Temporal Scope**: Define the area and time period of interest. For sparse data, limit extrapolation beyond the convex hull of sample points to avoid unreliable predictions.\n\n\n- **Sources of Uncertainty**:\n  - **Model Errors**: Different models may excel at simulating specific variables (e.g., temperature vs. precipitation). Accept that no single model is perfect and use ensemble approaches.\n  - **Observational Limitations**: Real-world data (e.g., satellite measurements) may have noise or gaps. Use techniques like **kriging** to interpolate data while quantifying uncertainty.\n  - **Statistical Uncertainties**: Account for variability in data distributions and avoid overfitting by using robust statistical tools (e.g., bootstrapping, cross-validation).\n\n- **Probabilistic Interpretation**:\n  - Embrace probabilistic answers when uncertainties are high. For example, instead of claiming a model \"predicts\" a future climate state, present confidence intervals or likelihoods.",

Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}]",

If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\\n\\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \\n\\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement.

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903424269054, 'score': 0.6151569, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_41_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': 'One can also modify the CDS API download script using optional post-processing arguments.\\n\\nFor example, one can use the `grid` option to change the grid on which the data are presented.  \\n\\nThe native grid of ERA data on CDS is 0.25°x0.25° (atmosphere), 0.5°x0.5° (ocean waves) for variables, while derived quantities, such as mean and variance are on a 0.5°x0.5° (atmosphere) and a coarser 1°x1° (ocean waves).

The big question is what values should the weight corresponding to each sample have? Answering this question is not easy - it is basically the whole point of kriging. The answer will depend on any additional constraints that one applies on these weights and on any additional properties one wishes the field $F$ or $D$ to have (stationarity of various moments, isotropy, etc.). Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}]",

For instance, if we were to set q[0,0], this could mean that the sailor **is** (S[i]) in the tavern, and **going** to the tavern (S[j]), so he has not actually gone anywhere in this case, but the quantity q[i,j] let's us represent the probability of each move happeneing. In this case, from the tavern, the sailor cannot go backwards, only forwrads towards the ship, so q[0,0]=1-f (i.e. the probability of staying in the tavern is equal to the probability of *not* moving forward).\\n\\nImagine, we start with the state that the sailor **is** in the tavern, so we can say p[0]=1, and set all other p[i]=0. \\n\\nFrom that starting point, we can now imagine what happens during the next step, i.e. the sailor can either move one step forward (i.e. out of the tavern, i.e. p[0] would decrease and p[1] would increase), or stay in the tavern. Whatever happens, though, the drunken sailor has **no memory** of what he did last time...as he is drunk, so each new move is independent of the last move, in a memoryless fashion. \\n\\nThe fact that moves are memoryless does not mean that probabilities of being a state cannot be calculated between steps though. During the second step, the probability of being in step 2, p[2] will depend on wether the sailor was in p[1] or p[0] after step 1, and this depends on the probabilities of moving (q[i,j], which ultimately depends on probabilities **f** and **b** or moving forward and backwards, and on the probabilities of being somewhere (p[i]). \\n\\nTo calculate the probabilities of the sailor being in any given state at a given time step, we simply need to keep track of all probabilities of getting there (q) from each current state (p), and sum them. \\n\\n$\\np’[i] = sum(p[j] · q[j,i])\\n$\\n\\nFor example, for the mid-way state, N=2, equidistant between the ship and the tavern, the probability of being there, i.e. in the new state p'[2] from any previous state 'p', can be represented by:\\n\\n$\\np'[2] = q[0,2] · p[0] + q[1,2]· p[1] + q[2,2]· p[2] + q[3,2]· p[3] + q[4,2]· p[4]\\n$\\n\\nand given our knowledge of the probabilities, we can simplify this as: \\n\\n$\\np’[2] = 0 · p[0] + f · p[1] + (1-f-b) · p[2] + b · p[3] + 0 · p[4]\\n$\\n\\nWe get get to N=2 by moving from step 1 forward, moving from step 3 backwards, or not moving from step 2. We cannot get to step 2 directly from step 0 or 4 (the tavern or the ship) as this would requires two steps (the sailor can only make one step at a time). \\n\\nWe can apply the same logic and calculate the probablilites of being anywhere. For example, the probability of being in step 1, p'[1] would be: \\n\\n$\\np'[1]=q[0,1] · p[0] + q[1,1]· p[1] + q[2,1]· p[2] + q[3,1]· p[3] + q[4,1]· p[4] \\\\\\\\\\np’[1] = f · p[0] + (1-f-b) · p[1] + b · p[2] + 0 · p[3] + 0 · p[4]  \\n$\\n\\nThe 'ps' and the 'qs' for all cases can be quantified and arranged into matrices **'P'** and **'Q'**, such that $P' = P · Q$. **P** is the state matrix, while **Q** is called the **transition** matrix. In the case of N=4, we see that the matrices P and Q are 5x5, or N+1 x N+1. A Markovian system is one where all we know is the current state and transition probabilities, but we don't know (or keep track) of what the previous states were (they don't affect the transition probabilities).\\n\\n\\nMarkovian systems ultimately become stationary in the sense that the distribution of the probabilities of being in each state converge towards stable distributions. When that happens,  $P = P’ = P’’ = P’’’ = ... = π$, that is the probability matrix that sets the probability of being in each state no longer evolves with each new iteration (i.e. the distribution of the probabilities describing the likelihood of being in each state p[i] doesn't change anymore with more iterations). When that happens, since p'[i]=p, we can write $\\\\pi=P=P'$ and so\\n\\n$\\n\\\\pi = \\\\pi \\\\cdot Q\\n$\\n\\nSince this represents a linear system, one could solve it for $\\\\pi$ and we see that $\\\\pi=eig(Q)$, so the probabilities of being in each state, given many steps through the random walk of the drunk sailor, are given by the eigenvalues of the transition matrix. Deriving this is beyond the scope of this introduction, but explanations can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). \\n\\nHere is a python example, assuming the drunken sailor is slightly more likely to go forward (f=0.7) than backward (b=0.2)...so maybe the sailor is not completely drunk yet. \", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_timeseriesanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 31}}, {'id': 1753907768115431, 'score': 0.6412235, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_timeseriesanalysis-IC-X9CYXD36RX.ipynb_cell_32_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='markov'></a>\\n## Markov Chains\\n\\nAnother way to model time series are Markov Chains.

For example, the probability of being in step 1, p'[1] would be: \\n\\n$\\np'[1]=q[0,1] · p[0] + q[1,1]· p[1] + q[2,1]· p[2] + q[3,1]· p[3] + q[4,1]· p[4] \\\\\\\\\\np’[1] = f · p[0] + (1-f-b) · p[1] + b · p[2] + 0 · p[3] + 0 · p[4]  \\n$\\n\\nThe 'ps' and the 'qs' for all cases can be quantified and arranged into matrices **'P'** and **'Q'**, such that $P' = P · Q$. **P** is the state matrix, while **Q** is called the **transition** matrix. In the case of N=4, we see that the matrices P and Q are 5x5, or N+1 x N+1. A Markovian system is one where all we know is the current state and transition probabilities, but we don't know (or keep track) of what the previous states were (they don't affect the transition probabilities).\\n\\n\\nMarkovian systems ultimately become stationary in the sense that the distribution of the probabilities of being in each state converge towards stable distributions. When that happens,  $P = P’ = P’’ = P’’’ = ... = π$, that is the probability matrix that sets the probability of being in each state no longer evolves with each new iteration (i.e. the distribution of the probabilities describing the likelihood of being in each state p[i] doesn't change anymore with more iterations). When that happens, since p'[i]=p, we can write $\\\\pi=P=P'$ and so\\n\\n$\\n\\\\pi = \\\\pi \\\\cdot Q\\n$\\n\\nSince this represents a linear system, one could solve it for $\\\\pi$ and we see that $\\\\pi=eig(Q)$, so the probabilities of being in each state, given many steps through the random walk of the drunk sailor, are given by the eigenvalues of the transition matrix. Deriving this is beyond the scope of this introduction, but explanations can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). \\n\\nHere is a python example, assuming the drunken sailor is slightly more likely to go forward (f=0.7) than backward (b=0.2)...so maybe the sailor is not completely drunk yet. \", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_timeseriesanalysis-IC-X9CYXD36RX.ipynb', 'cell_number': 32}}, {'id': 1753902702794239, 'score': 0.64107364, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_8', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'cool and warm the climateThe microphysics responsible for cloud formation is not well understoodThe grid cells in models are much much bigger than time/space scales relevant for cloud physicsÞMagnitude/location of rain events is hard to predict wellÞThat information is useful though!\\nComparing models with data•What is a data point?

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753905537095676, 'score': 0.6486036, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_timeseriesanalysis.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='timeseries'></a>\\n## Data with a time dimension\\n\\nEnvironmental scientists frequently need to analyse measurements that form a `sequence` - an ordered series. This series may be ordered in space (e.g. down a stratigraphic section) or in time (e.g. over the past 100 years). In either case, these are known as `time series`, and the term `time-series analysis` is used to describe the application of quantitative methods to discover patterns in the data. \\n\\nThe series variable can be defined either by a rank-order or by a quantitative measure of position along the series axis (time or space). To illustrate this, consider a tree rings.  A rank-order series is defined by the order that the rings appear, from inside to outside: first, second, third, ..., last.  A quantitative sequence measure, on the other hand, can be defined if each ring is dated, with ages: $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$, ..., $t_N$. (For tree rings, this is easy as one ring = one year.)\\n\\nA time-series consists of an observation at each entry in the rank-order or measured-time list.  This measurement can also be qualitative or quantitative.  As an example of the former, we might have a record of the presence or absence of a certain fossil-type in each layer of the stratigraphic sequence. The latter type of time-series, composed of quantitative observations, might be the height of water in a lake, the lateral displacement of a GPS station, or, in the case of tree rings, maybe the mass-fraction of a pollutant in the wood.\\n\\n[Time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series) data can be equally spaced or not, but if not, then extra care must be taken to analyze them. Time-series refer to sequence of discrete in time data. This also means that the points have a relationship with one-another, i.e some points cannot exist before, or after other points. That organization, containted in the order, can be exploited to learn more about real-world processes. \\n\\nData where time (or rank order, or sequential order) doesn't matter are sometimes called `cross sectional data`. These are sets of data observed at a single time, or where time has no meaning. \\n\\nTypically, time series data have the following form: \\n1. a time or index variable, or (when unlucky), multiple columns that have to be combined to create a meaningful time variable (this is often the case, when year, month, day, time, etc. are in different columns)\\n2. other columns of data with measurements/values of interest.\\n\\nNote that datasets can of course also contain [both cross-sectional and time series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsroWpkUuYI) information, in which case analysis can be performed for each time step, and across time steps, yielding for very rich analysis. For example, we could have data that measure the temporal evolution of some environmental variables in various locations. One could therefore compare locations spatially, at each time point, look at the evolution of the data at each station, and also do both. That is, time series analysis may not necessarily only concern 1D datasets, but also 2D, 3D, or ND datasets. \\n\\nIn general, we will consider time-series composed of $N$ entries indexed by an integer $i$ that goes from 1 to $N$.  For each value of $i$ we will have a measure of the position (e.g.~time), $t_i$, and a measure of some quantity at that time, $q_i$.  Hence a general time-series can be represented as\\n$\\n  t_1,\\\\, t_2,\\\\, t_3,\\\\,...,\\\\,t_{N-1},\\\\,t_N; \\\\\\\\\\n  q_1,\\\\, q_2,\\\\, q_3,\\\\,...,\\\\,q_{N-1},\\\\,q_N.\\n$\\n\\nA primary consideration in analysing a time-series is whether its entries are `regularly spaced`.

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903968044356, 'score': 0.62950504, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_4_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"\\n\\nThere are two types of interpolation problems: \\n1. interpolation from [`gridded data`](http://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/interpolating-gridded-data.html)\\n2. interolation from [`scattered data`](http://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/interpolating-scattered-data.html).\\n\\nInterpolation techniques designed for scattered data can of course also be used for gridded data.

The semivariogram, often defined as $\\\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \\n\\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\\n1.

It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data.

It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close.

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903968752811, 'score': 0.6251202, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_21_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='fitting'></a>\\n# Surface fitting\\n\\nThe interpolation techniques described above work very well when the space is relatively well-sampled, when one does not want to extrapolate beyond the convex hull and in the absence of variability or uncertainties associated the control points. If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\\n\\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \\n\\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement. The contoured estimate will tend to either over or underestimate the true value, within a tolerance controlled by the noise associated with the measurements. \\n\\nThe shape of the fitted surface will depend strongly on the data available: their locations, their uncertainties, as well as subjective choices made during the analysis (i.e. definition of the so-called 'covariance matrix').\\n\\nWe will here look at a technique called **kriging**, pioneered by a South African mining engineer called Danie G.

Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753901956747387, 'score': 0.6878973, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_1', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.4.

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902703272079, 'score': 0.6544875, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_14', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'vailable–The skill of the analyst is to know how far to push the interpretation and to select the correct model/simulations for the right question (exploit experimental design)•Main sources of uncertainties to consider•Numericsand choice of equations/implementation•Resolution•Parameterizations•Boundary conditions and forcing•Internal dynamics•Influence of uncertainties on final conclusions of analysis must be considered\\n\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf', 'chunk_number': 14}}, {'id': 1753902702662417, 'score': 0.651556, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_10', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ls that are ‘fitted’ to data•Some model parameters are tuned to fit–Question is what to fit/how?

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753903424262111, 'score': 0.64959604, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_38_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='reanalysis'></a>\\n\\n# Reanalysis products\\n\\n![C3S](img/c3s-logo.png)\\n![ECMWF](img/logo-ecmwf.png) \\n\\n[*ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables.

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}]"

    "response": "The provided text discusses key concepts in climate data science, including **reanalysis products**, **metadata conventions**, and **data formatting**. Here's a structured summary of the critical points:\n\n\n- **Definition**: Reanalysis products like **ERA5** are model-generated datasets that assimilate observational data (e.g., satellite, ground stations) to create a consistent, global representation of the climate system. They are not direct observations but **model outputs** adjusted to match observations.\n- **Key Features**:\n  - **ERA5**: \n    - Covers the period from **1950 to present**.\n    - Provides **hourly estimates** of atmospheric, land, and oceanic variables on a **30 km grid**.\n    - Uses **4D-Var** (a data assimilation technique) to integrate observations.\n    - Includes **uncertainty estimates** for variables.\n  - **Other Reanalysis Products**: \n    - **NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis**, **MERRA-2** (NASA), and others.\n  - **Purpose**: Fill spatial and temporal gaps in observational data, enabling global, consistent datasets for analysis.\n\n- **Important Notes**:\n  - Reanalysis products are **not observations** but **model-based interpolations**.\n  - **Grid Geometry**: \n    - **GRIB format**: Native model grid (non-regular lat/lon).\n    - **NetCDF format**: Automatically regridded to a **regular lat/lon grid**, which may affect variable conservation.\n  - **Longitude Wrap-Around**: \n    - Data spans **0–360° longitude**, with **0° and 360°** being the same point. Software may need to handle this to avoid errors.\n\n\n- **Purpose**: Standardize metadata to ensure **interoperability** and **self-describing datasets**.\n- **Key Aspects**:\n  - **Standard Names**: Variables like \"temperature\" are assigned standardized names (e.g., `air_temperature`) to avoid ambiguity.\n  - **Units and Coordinates**: \n    - Variables include **physical units** (e.g., Kelvin, meters",

NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\\n\\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \\n\\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\\n\\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\\n\\n\\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)). [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu) also manages [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu), one of the first center to have developped climate models and is today one of the gold-standard on the topic. \\n\\nNCAR also developed [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu), an interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization (we will not use NCL here, but the python package `ESMValTool` has build-in support for it). \\n\\n[NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu) has also developped the [climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu), a tool to search and access >200 data sets specific to the ocean, land and the atmosphere.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}]",

    "response": "Climate models are essential tools for understanding and predicting Earth's climate system. They integrate physical, chemical, and biological processes across the atmosphere, oceans, land, and cryosphere, simulating interactions between these components. Here's a structured overview of key concepts and challenges:\n\n\n- **Coupling Mechanisms**: Models divide the Earth into discrete grids (e.g., atmospheric, oceanic, land) and simulate exchanges of energy, momentum, and matter at their interfaces. For example:\n  - **Heat and Water**: Evaporation, precipitation, and latent heat transfer.\n  - **Momentum**: Wind patterns and ocean currents.\n  - **Energy**: Radiative forcing from greenhouse gases and solar input.\n- **Time Scales**: Models operate across vast temporal ranges, from seconds (e.g., cloud microphysics) to centuries (e.g., ice sheet dynamics). For instance:\n  - **10⁶ seconds ≈ 11 days** (short-term weather).\n  - **10¹⁰ seconds ≈ 300 years** (long-term climate trends).\n\n\n- **Teleconnections and Feedbacks**: Models capture large-scale interactions (e.g., El Niño effects on global weather) and feedback loops (e.g., ice-albedo effect).\n- **Uncertainty Analysis**: Projects like the **Model Intercomparison Project (MIP)** compare outputs across models to quantify uncertainties and improve predictions.\n- **Reanalysis Products**: Combine models with real-world data (e.g., satellite observations) to create high-resolution historical climate records, useful for studying past trends.\n\n\n- **Resolution Constraints**: Grid cells are often too coarse to resolve small-scale processes (e.g., cloud physics), leading to uncertainties in precipitation and extreme weather events.\n- **Parameterization**: Complex processes (e.g., turbulence, convection) are approximated using simplified equations, introducing potential biases.\n- **Data Assimilation**: Techniques like **4DVAR** integrate observational data into models to refine predictions, but this requires careful calibration to avoid overfitting.\n- **Model Incompleteness**: No model is perfect; they are \"incomplete\" but internally consistent, providing valuable insights despite limitations.\n\n\n- **Validation**: Models are tested against observational data (e.g., temperature records, satellite measurements) to assess accuracy and guide improvements.\n- **Observational System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs)**: Simulate how better observational networks could enhance model performance, informing future data",

[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)).

    "response": "The discussion revolves around the complexities and limitations of climate models, their validation, and the challenges of interpreting results within uncertainties. Here's a structured summary of key insights:\n\n   - **Cloud Formation and Rain Prediction**: Climate models struggle to capture microphysical processes (e.g., cloud dynamics, precipitation mechanisms) due to grid cells being much larger than the scales of these phenomena. This leads to challenges in predicting rain event magnitudes and locations, even though such details are critical for regional climate studies.\n   - **Resolution Trade-offs**: Higher-resolution models can better represent topography, bathymetry, and subgrid-scale processes (e.g., eddies), but they require more computational resources and data. Lower-resolution models may rely on parameterizations (approximations) for unresolved processes, which can introduce biases.\n\n   - **Observational Challenges**: Comparing model outputs to observational data is complex. Model solutions may not align with observational samples spatially or temporally, especially for variables like precipitation or extreme weather events. This highlights the need for robust statistical methods to quantify discrepancies.\n   - **Ensemble Simulations**: Ensemble runs (e.g., multiple simulations with perturbed initial conditions or parameters) help distinguish between internal variability (natural climate fluctuations) and \"forced\" responses (driven by external factors like greenhouse gas emissions). This is critical for isolating climate signals from noise.\n\n   - **Probabilistic Approaches**: Given model imperfections, probabilistic frameworks (e.g., uncertainty ranges, confidence intervals) are essential for interpreting results. For example, models may provide probabilistic forecasts for extreme events rather than deterministic predictions.\n   - **Model Selection**: Choosing the \"best\" model depends on the analysis goals. Simpler models may suffice for broad-scale trends, while high-resolution models are needed for localized studies. Trade-offs between computational cost and accuracy must be balanced.\n\n   - **Non-Stationary Data**: Climate data often exhibit non-stationarity (e.g., trends, seasonal cycles). Techniques like detrending or decomposition (e.g., Fourier analysis) are used to isolate meaningful signals from noise. Synthetic time series (e.g., random walks) are sometimes used to test analytical methods.\n   - **Practical Applications**: Tools like Python libraries (e.g., `pandas`, `statsmodels`) enable practitioners to analyze stationarity, detrend data, and validate models against synthetic or observational datasets.\n\n   - **Accept Imperfection",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753903424509295, 'score': 0.6351379, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 01- Introduction to climate data and climate models\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n## Contents\\n- [Lectures](#lectures)\\n- [Question](#question)\\n- [ESMValTool](#ESMValTool)\\n- [Sources of climate data](#climatedata)\\n- [CEDA](#CEDA)\\n- [File formats](#fileformat)\\n- [Metadata](#metadata)\\n- [NetCDF](#NetCDF)\\n- [NCO](#NCO)\\n- [Reanalysis products](#reanalysis)\\n- [Climate services UKCP18](#ukcp18)\\n  \\n## Learning outcomes\\n1.

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \\n\\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe (\\'18\\' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \\n\\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that\\'s a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \\n\\nAlthough UKCP18 is \\'just\\' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\\n\\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\\n\\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn\\'t contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \\n\\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\\n\\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \\n\\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\\n\\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \\nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \\n\\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \\n\\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \\n\\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \\n\\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\\n3. Output: Data only\\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\\n   \\nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \\n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \\n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \\n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \\n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can\\'t differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \\n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that\\'s a lot of data!).\\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \\n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \\n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \\n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don\\'t close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \\n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \\n\\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\\n\\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \\n\\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we\\'ll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\\n\\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 46}}, {'id': 1753903424262111, 'score': 0.63907886, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_38_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='reanalysis'></a>\\n\\n# Reanalysis products\\n\\n![C3S](img/c3s-logo.png)\\n![ECMWF](img/logo-ecmwf.png) \\n\\n[*ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables. The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}]",

Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\\n\\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \\n\\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\\\left(1-exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-h}{ra}\\\\right)\\\\right)+n_{(0,\\\\infty)}\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\n    \\n2.

It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data.

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903967981470, 'score': 0.6239765, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_0_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 03 Environmental Data: Thinking spatially\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n* ## Contents\\n- [Spatial data](#spatial)\\n- [Surface interpolation](#surface)\\n- [Gridded data](#gridded)\\n- [Scattered data](#scattered)\\n- [Surface fitting](#fitting)\\n- [Plotting and manipulating spatial data](#plotting)\\n- [Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)](#crs)\\n- [Geopandas](#geopandas)\\n- [Cartopy](#cartopy)\\n- [A nicer example](#example)\\n  \\n* ## Learning outcomes\\n1.

    "response": "The provided text snippets highlight key concepts and tools for analyzing spatial climate data, emphasizing the interplay between data handling, uncertainty, and computational methods. Here's a structured summary of the core ideas:\n\n\n- **Types of Data**: \n  - **Gridded data** (e.g., ERA5 at 0.1°x0.1° resolution) and **scattered data** (discrete measurements) are common. \n  - **Derived quantities** (e.g., mean, variance) often use coarser grids (e.g., 1°x1° for ocean waves).\n- **Challenges**: \n  - Interpreting spatially dispersed data requires **contouring** (estimating fields between sampled points) or **surface fitting** (minimizing prediction errors).\n  - Discontinuities (e.g., land-sea boundaries) can mislead interpolation algorithms if not handled carefully.\n\n\n- **Interpolation**: \n  - Fills gaps between known points (e.g., kriging, IDW). \n  - Limited by the **convex hull** of data points; extrapolation beyond this can introduce artifacts.\n- **Surface Fitting**: \n  - Uses statistical models (e.g., geostatistics) to fit a function to data, balancing accuracy and generalization.\n  - Tools like **Geopandas** and **Cartopy** enable spatial operations and visualization.\n\n\n- **Sources of Uncertainty**:\n  - **Numerical approximations** (e.g., model resolution, parameterizations).\n  - **Boundary conditions** and **forcing data** (e.g., external inputs like CO₂ concentrations).\n  - **Internal dynamics** (e.g., chaotic weather patterns).\n- **Mitigation Strategies**:\n  - **Experimental design**: Select appropriate models/simulations for specific questions.\n  - **Sensitivity analysis**: Quantify how uncertainties affect conclusions.\n  - **Error characterization**: Explicitly report measurement errors and environmental uncertainties.\n\n\n- **Grid Customization**:\n  - Use APIs like the **CDS API** to adjust resolution (e.g., downsample to 1°x1°) or select sub-domains to reduce computational load.\n  - Example: ERA5-Land provides 0.1°x0.1° resolution, but coarser grids may suffice for regional studies.\n- **Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)**:\n  - Ensure data alignment with appropriate projections (e.g., WGS84 for global datasets).\n\n\n- **Python Libraries**:\n  - **Geopandas**: For spatial data manipulation and analysis.\n  - **Cartopy**: For map projections and geospatial visualization.\n  - **PROJ/GDAL**: Underpin many geospatial tools for coordinate transformations.\n- **Data Sources**:\n  - **ERA5** (ECMWF) provides high-resolution atmospheric and oceanic data.\n  - **CDS API**: Enables efficient downloading and post-processing of climate datasets.\n\n\n- **Data Analysis Strategy**:\n  - Combine statistical tools (e.g., autocorrelation for time-series) with modeling approaches.\n  - Validate results against known uncertainties and environmental constraints.\n- **Interpretation**:\n  - Avoid over-interpreting results; recognize the limitations of interpolation and model assumptions.\n  - Use **objective** (algorithmic) methods to reduce subjective bias in mapping.",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753902702794239, 'score': 0.6346027, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_8', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'cool and warm the climateThe microphysics responsible for cloud formation is not well understoodThe grid cells in models are much much bigger than time/space scales relevant for cloud physicsÞMagnitude/location of rain events is hard to predict wellÞThat information is useful though!\\nComparing models with data•What is a data point?

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902702922525, 'score': 0.6294217, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_0', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'Are climate models any good or useful at all?\\nhttps://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/visualizations-hurricanes/\\nData or model?\\nCommon misconceptions about modeling1.The goal of modeling is to reproduce data2.If a model doesn’t fit the data, the model is useless (…and modeler also)3.Since modelers don’t measure anything, they don’t know anything about data or care about them4.Measurement(s) of “X” can be used to better constrain climate models5.Process “W” is not explicitly implemented in the model,hence the ', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf', 'chunk_number': 0}}]",

    "response": "Climate models are essential tools for understanding and predicting Earth's climate system, but they inherently face several limitations and challenges. Here's a structured overview of their key aspects, based on the provided contexts:\n\n\n- **Spatial and Temporal Resolution**:  \n  - Grid cells in models are often too coarse to capture small-scale processes like cloud microphysics or localized weather events (e.g., rain). This leads to uncertainties in predicting phenomena like precipitation patterns.  \n  - **Example**: Cloud formation involves complex interactions at scales smaller than typical model resolutions, making it difficult to simulate accurately.\n\n- **Parameterization of Processes**:  \n  - Many physical processes (e.g., turbulence, convection, aerosol effects) are simplified or approximated due to computational constraints. These parameterizations can introduce errors, especially when processes operate on different time/space scales.  \n  - **Example**: The microphysics of cloud formation is not fully resolved, leading to uncertainties in rainfall predictions.\n\n- **Inherent Uncertainties**:  \n  - Models cannot perfectly represent all aspects of the climate system. For instance, feedback mechanisms (e.g., ice-albedo, cloud-radiation) are complex and may not be captured with sufficient accuracy.  \n  - **Example**: A model might reproduce the mean climate state well but fail to capture variability (e.g., El Niño events).\n\n\n- **Comparison with Observations**:  \n  - Models are validated against observational data (e.g., temperature, precipitation). However, discrepancies arise due to:  \n    - **Data quality**: Observational data may have gaps or biases.  \n    - **Model biases**: For example, models may consistently overestimate or underestimate certain variables (e.g., surface temperatures).  \n  - **Key Question**: How do model outputs align with real-world data, and what adjustments are needed?\n\n- **Metrics and Ensemble Simulations**:  \n  - **Metrics**: Performance is assessed using metrics like root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficients, or skill scores. However, choosing the \"best\" metric is subjective and depends on the analysis goal.  \n  - **Ensemble Runs**: Running multiple simulations (ensembles) helps quantify uncertainty. For example, 100s of ensemble runs can reveal the range of possible outcomes for a given scenario.  \n  - **Example**: Averaged surface temperature anomalies from ensemble simulations can highlight trends despite individual model biases.\n\n- **Trade-offs Between Resolution and Computational Cost**:  \n  - **High Resolution**: Captures local extremes and short-term events but requires more computational resources and fewer ensemble members.  \n  - **Low Resolution**: Simulates longer-term trends with many ensembles but may miss critical details.  \n  - **Balance**: Higher resolution is often prioritized for specific analyses (e.g., regional climate studies), while lower resolution is used for global projections.\n\n\n-",

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902300429530, 'score': 0.656875, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_6', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ce scales of interest–Integration time step–Spatial resolution of the grid–Duration of model run–Decisions about time/space scales also translate into “filtering” the equations •(parts of the equations can be neglected and the equations simplified –some physics can be neglected/simplified)\\nWhy model climate?\\n\\nWeather and climate –bridging the gap\\n\\n\\nWhat are coupledclimatemodels?\\n\\nA few key major coupling mechanisms between the ocean and the atmosphere\\nThe “coupler” is the heart of climate models', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 6}}, {'id': 1753902702794239, 'score': 0.6474985, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_8', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'cool and warm the climateThe microphysics responsible for cloud formation is not well understoodThe grid cells in models are much much bigger than time/space scales relevant for cloud physicsÞMagnitude/location of rain events is hard to predict wellÞThat information is useful though!\\nComparing models with data•What is a data point?

These are particularly useful when a process can take on a finite number of states, with varying probabilities. \\n\\nA system consisting of mutually exclusive states and probabilistic transitions between them is called a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) (after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov).\\n\\nThey are often linked to a technique called [`Markov Chain Monte Carlo`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo), which are a class of algorithms for sampling from a probability distribution.

For instance, if we were to set q[0,0], this could mean that the sailor **is** (S[i]) in the tavern, and **going** to the tavern (S[j]), so he has not actually gone anywhere in this case, but the quantity q[i,j] let's us represent the probability of each move happeneing. In this case, from the tavern, the sailor cannot go backwards, only forwrads towards the ship, so q[0,0]=1-f (i.e. the probability of staying in the tavern is equal to the probability of *not* moving forward).\\n\\nImagine, we start with the state that the sailor **is** in the tavern, so we can say p[0]=1, and set all other p[i]=0. \\n\\nFrom that starting point, we can now imagine what happens during the next step, i.e. the sailor can either move one step forward (i.e. out of the tavern, i.e. p[0] would decrease and p[1] would increase), or stay in the tavern. Whatever happens, though, the drunken sailor has **no memory** of what he did last time...as he is drunk, so each new move is independent of the last move, in a memoryless fashion. \\n\\nThe fact that moves are memoryless does not mean that probabilities of being a state cannot be calculated between steps though. During the second step, the probability of being in step 2, p[2] will depend on wether the sailor was in p[1] or p[0] after step 1, and this depends on the probabilities of moving (q[i,j], which ultimately depends on probabilities **f** and **b** or moving forward and backwards, and on the probabilities of being somewhere (p[i]). \\n\\nTo calculate the probabilities of the sailor being in any given state at a given time step, we simply need to keep track of all probabilities of getting there (q) from each current state (p), and sum them. \\n\\n$\\np’[i] = sum(p[j] · q[j,i])\\n$\\n\\nFor example, for the mid-way state, N=2, equidistant between the ship and the tavern, the probability of being there, i.e. in the new state p'[2] from any previous state 'p', can be represented by:\\n\\n$\\np'[2] = q[0,2] · p[0] + q[1,2]· p[1] + q[2,2]· p[2] + q[3,2]· p[3] + q[4,2]· p[4]\\n$\\n\\nand given our knowledge of the probabilities, we can simplify this as: \\n\\n$\\np’[2] = 0 · p[0] + f · p[1] + (1-f-b) · p[2] + b · p[3] + 0 · p[4]\\n$\\n\\nWe get get to N=2 by moving from step 1 forward, moving from step 3 backwards, or not moving from step 2. We cannot get to step 2 directly from step 0 or 4 (the tavern or the ship) as this would requires two steps (the sailor can only make one step at a time). \\n\\nWe can apply the same logic and calculate the probablilites of being anywhere. For example, the probability of being in step 1, p'[1] would be: \\n\\n$\\np'[1]=q[0,1] · p[0] + q[1,1]· p[1] + q[2,1]· p[2] + q[3,1]· p[3] + q[4,1]· p[4] \\\\\\\\\\np’[1] = f · p[0] + (1-f-b) · p[1] + b · p[2] + 0 · p[3] + 0 · p[4]  \\n$\\n\\nThe 'ps' and the 'qs' for all cases can be quantified and arranged into matrices **'P'** and **'Q'**, such that $P' = P · Q$. **P** is the state matrix, while **Q** is called the **transition** matrix. In the case of N=4, we see that the matrices P and Q are 5x5, or N+1 x N+1. A Markovian system is one where all we know is the current state and transition probabilities, but we don't know (or keep track) of what the previous states were (they don't affect the transition probabilities).\\n\\n\\nMarkovian systems ultimately become stationary in the sense that the distribution of the probabilities of being in each state converge towards stable distributions. When that happens,  $P = P’ = P’’ = P’’’ = ... = π$, that is the probability matrix that sets the probability of being in each state no longer evolves with each new iteration (i.e. the distribution of the probabilities describing the likelihood of being in each state p[i] doesn't change anymore with more iterations).

Here's a structured summary of the main points:\n\n   - **Choosing the Best Model**: Model performance depends on the specific analysis. Metrics like RMSE, MAE, or R² are judgment calls, balancing simplicity (e.g., using basic models if they suffice) against complexity.  \n   - **Internal vs. Forced Response**: Climate models must distinguish natural variability (internal variability) from human-driven changes (forced response). Ensemble simulations help quantify uncertainties in these distinctions.  \n   - **Ensemble Simulations**: Modern models generate hundreds of ensemble runs to capture uncertainty, though this requires significant computational resources.  \n\n   - **High-Resolution Models**: Capture local extremes and short-term processes but demand more data, shorter simulations, and fewer ensembles.  \n   - **Low-Resolution Models**: Simulate longer periods with broader spatial coverage but may miss localized phenomena.  \n   - **Practical Balance**: Simplicity is preferred when possible, as overly complex models risk overfitting or computational inefficiency.  \n\n   - **Data Constraints**: Analyze data types (e.g., observational vs. model outputs) while accounting for distributional limitations and uncertainties (e.g., measurement errors, environmental variability).  \n   - **Experimental Design**: Critical for climate models, such as the **Model Intercomparison Project (MIP)**, which standardizes experiments to compare sensitivities to different forcings (e.g., CO₂ emissions).  \n   - **Real-World Limitations**: Only one \"Earth\" exists, so models must be validated against historical data while acknowledging inherent uncertainties.  \n\n   - **Climate Ensemble**: Multiple simulations (ensembles) account for uncertainties in initial conditions, model parameters, and external forcings.  \n   - **Sensitivity Studies**: Identify how model outputs respond to changes in inputs (e.g., greenhouse gas concentrations), guiding improvements in model structure.  \n\n   - **Imperfect Models**: Accept that models are inherently limited but focus on maximizing utility through simplicity and rigorous validation.  \n   - **Scientific Knowledge**: Balancing model complexity with practicality requires deep domain expertise and clear problem definitions.  \n   - **Uncertainty Quantification**: Comprehensive uncertainty analysis is essential for interpreting results, especially in climate projections.  \n\nThese insights underscore the interdisciplinary nature of climate science, blending statistical rigor, computational modeling, and environmental understanding to address complex, real-world challenges.",

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903967981470, 'score': 0.6367384, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_0_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 03 Environmental Data: Thinking spatially\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n* ## Contents\\n- [Spatial data](#spatial)\\n- [Surface interpolation](#surface)\\n- [Gridded data](#gridded)\\n- [Scattered data](#scattered)\\n- [Surface fitting](#fitting)\\n- [Plotting and manipulating spatial data](#plotting)\\n- [Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)](#crs)\\n- [Geopandas](#geopandas)\\n- [Cartopy](#cartopy)\\n- [A nicer example](#example)\\n  \\n* ## Learning outcomes\\n1.

Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\\n\\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \\n\\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\\\left(1-exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-h}{ra}\\\\right)\\\\right)+n_{(0,\\\\infty)}\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\n    \\n2.

It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$. At this point, one can either compute the **spatial covariance**\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nC(k \\\\Delta h)=\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k\\\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nfrom which we can compute the **correlogram**, which is simply the spatial covariance normalized by the data variance (at $k=0$) so as to limit its range to $\\\\pm 1$,\\n\\n\\\\label{eq:corelogram}\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\rho(k \\\\Delta  h)=\\\\frac{C(k \\\\Delta h)}{C(0)}=\\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k \\\\Delta  h)d(x_i)}{\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^m(d(x_i)^2)}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nor look at the mean squared difference and form the **semivariogram**\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\gamma(k \\\\Delta  h)=\\\\frac{1}{2m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^m\\\\left(d(x_i+k\\\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\\\right)^2.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nThe functional forms $C(h)$, $\\\\rho(h)$ or $\\\\gamma(h)$ of these binned, discrete estimates is obtained simply by plotting $C(k\\\\Delta h)$, $\\\\rho(k\\\\Delta  h)$ or $\\\\gamma(k\\\\Delta  h)$ as a function of $k\\\\Delta h$ and by fitting a polynomial throught the results that ensures strictly positive values of $C(h)$, $\\\\rho(h)$ or $\\\\gamma(h)$ for any $h$.\\n\\nNote that the corelogram in geostatistics is very similar to the autocorrelation function used in time-series analysis.

Common models include:\n    1. **Exponential**:  \n       $ \\gamma(h) = (s - n)\\left(1 - e^{-h/ra}\\right) + n $\n    2. **Gaussian**:  \n       $ \\gamma(h) = (s - n)\\left(1 - e^{-h^2/a^2}\\right) + n $\n    3. **Spherical**:  \n       $ \\gamma(h) = (s - n)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{h}{a} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{h}{a}\\right)^3\\right) $ for $ h \\leq a $, and $ s - n $ for $ h > a $.\n  - Parameters:\n    - **Sill (s)**: Variance at large distances (maximum spatial correlation).\n    - **Range (a)**: Distance where spatial correlation becomes negligible.\n    - **Nugget (n)**: Small-scale variability or measurement error.\n\n- **Empirical Variogram Estimation**:\n  - Compute **semivariograms** or **correlograms** by binning data pairs by distance.\n  - These are used to fit theoretical models and inform kriging.\n\n- **Anisotropic Variograms**:\n  - Account for directional dependence (e.g., ocean currents influenced by Earth rotation).\n  - Used in oceanography to model long longitudinal and short latitudinal ranges.\n\n\n- **Key Objectives**:\n  - Design data analysis strategies considering data types, distribution, and uncertainties.\n  - Understand limitations of data and tools, including measurement errors and environmental variability.\n  - Characterize uncertainties and interpret results within their context.\n\n\n- **Code Examples**:\n  - Use `matplotlib` for contour plots and `numpy` for meshgrid generation.\n  - Example: Visualizing a sparsely sampled function with `contourf` and `pcolormesh`.\n\n- **Tools & Libraries**:\n  - Python libraries like `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and geostatistical packages (e.g., `pykrige`) are essential for spatial analysis.\n\n\n- **Data Sparsity**: Requires robust interpolation methods like kriging.\n- **Uncertainty Quantification",

    "response": "Here's a structured summary of the key topics and tools related to climate data and modeling, organized from the provided lists:\n\n\n**Key Concepts:**  \n- **Purpose of Climate Models**: Simulate Earth's climate system (atmosphere, oceans, ice, land) to study past, present, and future climate scenarios.  \n- **Discretization**: Breaking continuous space/time into discrete grids (e.g., 3D grids for spatial data, time steps for temporal resolution).  \n  - **Challenges**:  \n    - Smaller grid sizes improve resolution but increase computational cost.  \n    - Grid mismatches between modules (e.g., atmosphere vs. ocean) complicate coupling.  \n- **Coupling Models**:  \n  - **Purpose**: Exchange data (heat, momentum, water) between subsystems (e.g., atmosphere-ocean interactions).  \n  - **Challenges**:  \n    - Nonlinear feedbacks (e.g., teleconnections) require precise synchronization.  \n    - Grid-scale mismatches (e.g., atmospheric vs. oceanic resolution).  \n- **Subgrid-Scale Processes**:  \n  - **Parameterization**: Represent small-scale phenomena (e.g., clouds, turbulence) that cannot be resolved directly.  \n  - **Examples**: Eddies, overflows, and topography effects on currents.  \n- **Uncertainties and Sensitivities**:  \n  - **Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs)**: Compare models to assess uncertainties (e.g., CMIP6).  \n  - **Ensemble Experiments**: Test sensitivity to initial conditions or parameterizations.  \n\n\n**Key Tools and Formats:**  \n- **NetCDF (Network Common Data Form)**:  \n  - **Purpose**: A self-describing, machine-independent format for storing multidimensional scientific data (e.g., climate variables).  \n  - **Features**:  \n    - **Metadata**: Includes variable units, coordinates, and descriptions.  \n    - **Scalability**: Efficiently handles large datasets (e.g., global climate models).  \n    - **Portability**: Works across different operating systems and architectures.  \n  - **Related Tools**:  \n    - **NCO (NetCDF Operators)**: A suite of command-line tools for data processing (e.g., filtering, regridding).  \n    - **CDO (Climate Data Operators)**: Over 600 operators for climate data analysis (e.g., calculating indices, diagnostics).  \n      - **Advantages**: More comprehensive than NCO but slightly slower.  \n      - **Use Cases**: Reanalysis products, ensemble analysis, and diagnostics.  \n- **Other Tools**:  \n  - **ESMValTool**: A Python-based tool for evaluating climate models and reanalysis data.  \n  - **NCL (NCAR Command Language)**: A programming language for data analysis and visualization (used in ESMValTool).  \n  - **Climate Data Guide**: A resource for finding and accessing climate datasets (e.g., from NCAR).",

It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902703503123, 'score': 0.68225527, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_1', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'model cannot model the effect of “Z” on climate as “W” has or may have an (unquantified) effect of the “Z” and may effectCO2or T, etc. … therefore climate models are useless\\nSome better propositions1.All models are “wrong” and “incomplete”(modeling with the sole goal of fitting data can be futile)(state-or-the-art models have many free parameters, uniqueness of the fit/solution is not always guaranteed –fit for wrong reason possible)2.Models have the merit of being internally consistent and poss', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf', 'chunk_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753902702794239, 'score': 0.68145335, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_8', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'cool and warm the climateThe microphysics responsible for cloud formation is not well understoodThe grid cells in models are much much bigger than time/space scales relevant for cloud physicsÞMagnitude/location of rain events is hard to predict wellÞThat information is useful though!\\nComparing models with data•What is a data point?

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424804905, 'score': 0.6481531, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_42_code', 'type': 'code', 'content': \"#!/usr/bin/env python\\nimport cdsapi\\n \\nc = cdsapi.Client()\\n \\nc.retrieve(\\n    'reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels',\\n    {\\n        'product_type': 'reanalysis',\\n        'variable': 'temperature',\\n        'pressure_level': '1000',\\n        'year': '2021',\\n        'month': '01',\\n        'day': '01',\\n        'time': '12:00',\\n        'format': 'netcdf',                         # NetCDF\\n        'area'          : [60., -11., 34., 35.],    # Default area is global; provide [North, West, South, East] limits to select an area (here selecting Europe)\\n        'grid'          : [1.0, 1.0],               #  Default atmospheric resolution is 0.25 x 0.25; provie [Latitude/longitude] grid resolution to interpolate data to something else.           \\n    },\\n    'output/ERAtest_subarea_1deg1deg.nc')           # Output file.

While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424804905, 'score': 0.70801824, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_42_code', 'type': 'code', 'content': \"#!/usr/bin/env python\\nimport cdsapi\\n \\nc = cdsapi.Client()\\n \\nc.retrieve(\\n    'reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels',\\n    {\\n        'product_type': 'reanalysis',\\n        'variable': 'temperature',\\n        'pressure_level': '1000',\\n        'year': '2021',\\n        'month': '01',\\n        'day': '01',\\n        'time': '12:00',\\n        'format': 'netcdf',                         # NetCDF\\n        'area'          : [60., -11., 34., 35.],    # Default area is global; provide [North, West, South, East] limits to select an area (here selecting Europe)\\n        'grid'          : [1.0, 1.0],               #  Default atmospheric resolution is 0.25 x 0.25; provie [Latitude/longitude] grid resolution to interpolate data to something else.           \\n    },\\n    'output/ERAtest_subarea_1deg1deg.nc')           # Output file.

A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable.

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!).

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424804905, 'score': 0.74559265, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_42_code', 'type': 'code', 'content': \"#!/usr/bin/env python\\nimport cdsapi\\n \\nc = cdsapi.Client()\\n \\nc.retrieve(\\n    'reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels',\\n    {\\n        'product_type': 'reanalysis',\\n        'variable': 'temperature',\\n        'pressure_level': '1000',\\n        'year': '2021',\\n        'month': '01',\\n        'day': '01',\\n        'time': '12:00',\\n        'format': 'netcdf',                         # NetCDF\\n        'area'          : [60., -11., 34., 35.],    # Default area is global; provide [North, West, South, East] limits to select an area (here selecting Europe)\\n        'grid'          : [1.0, 1.0],               #  Default atmospheric resolution is 0.25 x 0.25; provie [Latitude/longitude] grid resolution to interpolate data to something else.           \\n    },\\n    'output/ERAtest_subarea_1deg1deg.nc')           # Output file.

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753902702662417, 'score': 0.65432775, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_10', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ls that are ‘fitted’ to data•Some model parameters are tuned to fit–Question is what to fit/how?

NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\\n\\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \\n\\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\\n\\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\\n\\n\\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)). [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu) also manages [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu), one of the first center to have developped climate models and is today one of the gold-standard on the topic. \\n\\nNCAR also developed [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu), an interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization (we will not use NCL here, but the python package `ESMValTool` has build-in support for it). \\n\\n[NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu) has also developped the [climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu), a tool to search and access >200 data sets specific to the ocean, land and the atmosphere.

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753903424142956, 'score': 0.6563335, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_4_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='ESMValTool'></a>\\n\\n# Python environments to consider for working with climate data \\n\\n* ## Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool)\\n![esmvaltool](img/ESMValTool-logo-2.png)\\n\\nThis week, it should be possible to simply install packages as needed...\\n\\nHowever, if you anticipate possible future needs, you may want to invest a bit of effort to setup a specific python environment to work with climate data.

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424804905, 'score': 0.6522439, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_42_code', 'type': 'code', 'content': \"#!/usr/bin/env python\\nimport cdsapi\\n \\nc = cdsapi.Client()\\n \\nc.retrieve(\\n    'reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels',\\n    {\\n        'product_type': 'reanalysis',\\n        'variable': 'temperature',\\n        'pressure_level': '1000',\\n        'year': '2021',\\n        'month': '01',\\n        'day': '01',\\n        'time': '12:00',\\n        'format': 'netcdf',                         # NetCDF\\n        'area'          : [60., -11., 34., 35.],    # Default area is global; provide [North, West, South, East] limits to select an area (here selecting Europe)\\n        'grid'          : [1.0, 1.0],               #  Default atmospheric resolution is 0.25 x 0.25; provie [Latitude/longitude] grid resolution to interpolate data to something else.           \\n    },\\n    'output/ERAtest_subarea_1deg1deg.nc')           # Output file.

ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902703503123, 'score': 0.68966234, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_1', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'model cannot model the effect of “Z” on climate as “W” has or may have an (unquantified) effect of the “Z” and may effectCO2or T, etc. … therefore climate models are useless\\nSome better propositions1.All models are “wrong” and “incomplete”(modeling with the sole goal of fitting data can be futile)(state-or-the-art models have many free parameters, uniqueness of the fit/solution is not always guaranteed –fit for wrong reason possible)2.Models have the merit of being internally consistent and poss', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf', 'chunk_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903424509295, 'score': 0.68386245, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 01- Introduction to climate data and climate models\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n## Contents\\n- [Lectures](#lectures)\\n- [Question](#question)\\n- [ESMValTool](#ESMValTool)\\n- [Sources of climate data](#climatedata)\\n- [CEDA](#CEDA)\\n- [File formats](#fileformat)\\n- [Metadata](#metadata)\\n- [NetCDF](#NetCDF)\\n- [NCO](#NCO)\\n- [Reanalysis products](#reanalysis)\\n- [Climate services UKCP18](#ukcp18)\\n  \\n## Learning outcomes\\n1.

[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753902702697836, 'score': 0.6279312, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_5', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ent become stronger (strong exchange, although on shorter spatial scales, e.g.air-sea heat fluxes)•Better agreement with the way data are collected (i.e.what observations mean)–Averaging over space/time and variabilityhttps://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/climate-modeling/\\nGulf Stream\\nLabrador Sea~100km cells~10km cells\\nOcean resolution: 2 casesresolving eddies (the ocean’ storms)\\nFigure 6.1.

It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902702944729, 'score': 0.6981968, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_9', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'task.

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424595753, 'score': 0.6421058, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_40_code', 'type': 'code', 'content': \"#!/usr/bin/env python\\n# \\n# example useage of the CDS API: https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+download+ERA5#HowtodownloadERA5-3-DownloadingonlineERA5familydatathroughtheCDSwebinterface\\n#\\n# Downloading Air Temperature on the 1000 hPa level for a Jan 1st 2021 at 12:00.\\n#\\n\\nimport cdsapi\\n \\nc = cdsapi.Client()\\n \\nc.retrieve(\\n    'reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels',\\n    {\\n        'product_type': 'reanalysis',\\n        'variable': 'temperature',\\n        'pressure_level': '1000',\\n        'year': '2021',\\n        'month': '01',\\n        'day': '01',\\n        'time': '12:00',\\n        'format': 'netcdf',     # NetCDF format\\n    },\\n    'output/ERA5test.nc')       # Output file.

Here's a structured summary of key points and implications for users working with climate data:\n\n\n- **Definition**: ERA5 is a **reanalysis product**, meaning it combines **model simulations** with **observed data** to create a consistent, high-resolution representation of the Earth's climate system.\n- **Scope**: \n  - Covers the period from **January 1950 to the present**.\n  - Provides **hourly estimates** of atmospheric, land, and oceanic variables (e.g., temperature, wind, precipitation).\n  - Resolves the atmosphere using **137 vertical levels** (surface to 80 km height) on a **30 km grid**.\n- **Purpose**: \n  - Offers a **complete, global picture** of the climate system for analysis and modeling.\n  - Serves as a **proxy for observations** when direct measurements are unavailable.\n\n\n\n- **Not actual observations**: ERA5 is a **model product** that assimilates observational data (e.g., satellite, radiosonde, ground stations) using **4D-Var** (four-dimensional variational data assimilation).\n- **Limitations**: \n  - Subject to **model biases** and **physical constraints**.\n  - **Uncertainties** exist due to incomplete observational coverage and model approximations.\n\n- **Grid Systems**:\n  - **NetCDF format**: Data is **interpolated** to a **regular lat/lon grid** (e.g., -90 to +90° latitude, 0 to +360° longitude).\n  - **GRIB format**: Preserves the **model's native grid** (non-regular lat/lon), which may include wrap-around issues.\n- **Wrap-Around Handling**:\n  - Longitudes in GRIB format use **0–360°**, where 0° and 360° are the same point.\n  - Software must account for this to avoid misinterpretation of spatial relationships.\n\n- **Hourly data**: Available for most variables, with **daily and monthly updates**.\n- **Lag**: Monthly updates are published **3 months after real-time data**, while daily updates are available within **5 days**.\n\n\n\n- **CDS API**: Use the **Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS)** API to download data programmatically (e.g., Python scripts using `cdsapi`).\n- **Code Example**:\n  ```python\n  import cdsapi\n  c = cdsapi.Client()\n  c.retrieve(\n      'reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels',\n      {\n          'product_type': 'reanalysis',",

Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\\n\\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \\n\\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\\\left(1-exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-h}{ra}\\\\right)\\\\right)+n_{(0,\\\\infty)}\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\n    \\n2.

It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data.

If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\\n\\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \\n\\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement. The contoured estimate will tend to either over or underestimate the true value, within a tolerance controlled by the noise associated with the measurements. \\n\\nThe shape of the fitted surface will depend strongly on the data available: their locations, their uncertainties, as well as subjective choices made during the analysis (i.e. definition of the so-called 'covariance matrix').\\n\\nWe will here look at a technique called **kriging**, pioneered by a South African mining engineer called Danie G. Krige (1919-2013) and further formalized by geologist and mathematician Georges Matheron (1930-2000), who, together with Jean Serra, is often considered to be the founder of geostatistics.\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 21}}, {'id': 1753903968084902, 'score': 0.6085737, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='spatial'></a>\\n# Analysis of spatial data\\n\\nSo far in this class, we have mostly considered the analysis of data-series from single locations, where some property is measured repeadedly in time, or data that came already gridded in easy to use format. \\n\\nHowever, often in environmental sciences, we are faced with a different or additional problem; that is one will have to either make sense of many single measurements dispersed in space or even with multiple time-series dispersed in space. \\n\\nThe problem of making sense of spatially dispersed data is often linked to the problem of `contouring`. Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}]",

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424509295, 'score': 0.6502193, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 01- Introduction to climate data and climate models\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n## Contents\\n- [Lectures](#lectures)\\n- [Question](#question)\\n- [ESMValTool](#ESMValTool)\\n- [Sources of climate data](#climatedata)\\n- [CEDA](#CEDA)\\n- [File formats](#fileformat)\\n- [Metadata](#metadata)\\n- [NetCDF](#NetCDF)\\n- [NCO](#NCO)\\n- [Reanalysis products](#reanalysis)\\n- [Climate services UKCP18](#ukcp18)\\n  \\n## Learning outcomes\\n1.

While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page.

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}]",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+.

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902703222464, 'score': 0.62071824, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_12', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'n meanModel performance and deciding which is the best model?Which is the best “Metric” -a judgment call?\\nInternal variability vs “forced” response?Ensemble simulations\\nRun 1, 2, 3 are ‘ensemble’ runsToday, 100s of ensemble runs can be generatedThat’s a lot of data!\\nAveraged surface temperature anomaly\\nWhat model for what process, for what analysis?Choosing the best model product for the jobIf simple works, go simple!

    "response": "The provided text snippets highlight key aspects of building and evaluating climate models, emphasizing their complexity, computational trade-offs, and the balance between accuracy and practicality. Here's a structured summary of the main points:\n\n\n- **Equations and Parameterizations**: Models require fundamental equations (e.g., differential equations for variables like carbon concentration) and parameterizations to represent complex processes (e.g., cloud microphysics, ocean currents).\n- **Boundary and Initial Conditions**: Accurate starting points (e.g., initial atmospheric states) and boundary conditions (e.g., land-sea configurations) are critical for simulations.\n- **Conservation Laws**: Models must conserve mass, momentum, and energy to maintain physical consistency, which is essential for reliable predictions.\n\n\n- **Resolution Trade-offs**:\n  - **High Resolution**: Requires more data, shorter simulations, and fewer ensembles. It captures local extremes and fine-scale features but demands significant computational resources.\n  - **Low Resolution**: Uses less data, longer simulations, and more ensembles. It sacrifices detail for computational efficiency but may miss critical regional dynamics.\n- **Historical Context**: Early models (e.g., 1960s UNIVAC 1108) had limited memory (0.5MB), necessitating simplifications. Modern systems like the Cray XC30 leverage advanced hardware to balance complexity and speed.\n\n\n- **Numerical Diffusion**: Schemes used to solve equations can introduce artificial diffusion, leading to inaccuracies. Testing numerical cores without exact solutions highlights the need for robust validation.\n- **Scheme Strengths/Weaknesses",

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753902702794239, 'score': 0.6406866, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_8', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'cool and warm the climateThe microphysics responsible for cloud formation is not well understoodThe grid cells in models are much much bigger than time/space scales relevant for cloud physicsÞMagnitude/location of rain events is hard to predict wellÞThat information is useful though!\\nComparing models with data•What is a data point?

    "response": "The provided contexts discuss key aspects of climate modeling, data assimilation, and metadata conventions. Here's a structured summary of the main points:\n\n   - **Data Assimilation**: Techniques like 4DVAR (Four-Dimensional Variational Data Assimilation) integrate observational data with models to improve accuracy. This is critical for \"Reanalysis Products,\" which combine model simulations with real-world observations (e.g., weather forecasting).\n   - **Observational vs. Model Data**: Observations are \"just\" data, while models are \"just\" models. However, assimilating data into models (e.g., OSSE: Observational System Simulation Experiments) enhances their predictive power.\n\n   - **Resolution and Scale**: \n     - **High Resolution**: Captures local extremes and short-term simulations but requires more data and computational resources.\n     - **Low Resolution**: Uses longer simulations and ensembles to account for uncertainties but may miss small-scale processes (e.g., cloud physics).\n   - **Cloud Physics**: Microphysics (e.g., cloud formation) is poorly understood, making it hard to predict rain events accurately. However, such data remains valuable for improving models.\n\n   - **Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions**: These ensure self-descriptive datasets by standardizing variable names (e.g., \"temperature\") and units. They are vital for climate science, enabling comparisons across datasets and automating data processing.\n   - **Standard Names**: CF conventions provide a universal vocabulary (e.g., \"surface_temperature\") to avoid ambiguity in variables like temperature (air vs. ocean/land).\n\n   - **Imperfect Models**: Climate models are inherently imperfect but can be made useful by balancing simplicity with scientific rigor.\n   - **Uncertainty Management**: Analysts must account for uncertainties in numerics, equations, boundary conditions, and internal dynamics when interpreting model results.\n   - **Data Assimilation**: Critical for improving model accuracy, especially in reanalysis products that combine observations and simulations.\n\n   - **Metadata Importance**: Adhering to CF conventions ensures data interoperability and reduces errors in analysis.\n   - **Resolution Trade-offs**: Higher resolution improves local predictions but demands more computational resources, while lower resolution relies on ensemble methods to capture uncertainties.\n\nIf you have",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753903424623019, 'score': 0.63234377, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_37_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"### Climate Data Operators (CDO)\\nThe Climate Data Operators ([CDO](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo)) software is a collection of >600 operators for standard processing of climate and forecast model data.

CDO support the main data formats used in the field, such as GRIB and netCDF. \\n\\nThey too can be daisy-chained for specific applications. There are [many recipes available](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/embedded/cdo_eca.pdf) to calculate various climate indices and diagnostics, what makes them very attractive to evaluate gridded climate data or climate model output.\\n\\nThe [CDO user guide](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/embedded/index.html) provides details instructions and examples. \\n\\n[They are also very useful, but we don't have time to discuss them in detail here.

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units.

Here's a structured overview of their key aspects, challenges, and how they are addressed:\n\n\n- **Equations and Physics**: Models rely on fundamental laws (e.g., fluid dynamics, thermodynamics) and parameterizations for processes too small to resolve directly (e.g., cloud formation, turbulence).\n- **Grids and Resolution**: \n  - **High Resolution**: Captures local extremes and fine-scale features but requires more computational resources.\n  - **Low Resolution**: Simulates longer periods with many ensembles, balancing computational feasibility with broader trends.\n- **Initial and Boundary Conditions**: \n  - Initial conditions are based on observational data (e.g., current atmospheric states).\n  - Boundary conditions include external forcings (e.g., greenhouse gas concentrations, solar radiation).\n\n\n- **Inherent Uncertainty**:\n  - **Model Imperfections**: No model can perfectly represent all Earth system processes (e.g., feedbacks between ice, oceans, and atmosphere).\n  - **Parameterization Gaps**: Simplified representations of complex processes (e.g., convection, aerosol effects) introduce uncertainties.\n- **Resolution Trade-offs**:\n  - **High-Resolution Models**: Require vast computational power and may miss large-scale patterns.\n  - **Low-Resolution Models**: May overlook critical regional details or short-term variability.\n- **Data Assimilation**:\n  - **Reanalysis Products**: Combine models with real-world observations to improve accuracy (e.g., ERA5 datasets).\n  - **Observational System Simulation Experiments (OSSE)**: Test how well models can simulate observations, refining their parameterizations.\n\n\n- **Climate Data Operators (CDO)**:\n  - A suite of over 600 tools for processing climate data (e.g., calculating indices, regridding).\n  - Efficient for large datasets but less memory-intensive than NCO (another tool).\n- **Numerical Methods**:\n  - **Discretization**: Approximates continuous equations (e.g., finite difference methods) to simulate physical processes.\n  - **Schemes**: Advanced algorithms (e.g., Runge-Kutta) improve stability and accuracy.\n- **Ensemble Modeling**:\n  - Runs multiple simulations with varying initial conditions or parameters to quantify uncertainty and improve predictive confidence.\n\n\n- **Reanalysis Products**: \n  - Integrate models with observational data (e.g., satellite measurements) to create consistent, long-term climate records.\n  - Used in weather forecasting and climate studies.\n- **Model",

Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable.

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \\n\\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe (\\'18\\' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \\n\\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that\\'s a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \\n\\nAlthough UKCP18 is \\'just\\' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\\n\\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\\n\\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn\\'t contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \\n\\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\\n\\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \\n\\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\\n\\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \\nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \\n\\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \\n\\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \\n\\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \\n\\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\\n3. Output: Data only\\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\\n   \\nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \\n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \\n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \\n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \\n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can\\'t differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \\n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that\\'s a lot of data!).\\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \\n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \\n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \\n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don\\'t close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \\n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \\n\\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\\n\\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \\n\\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we\\'ll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\\n\\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 46}}]",

Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\\n\\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \\n\\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\\\left(1-exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-h}{ra}\\\\right)\\\\right)+n_{(0,\\\\infty)}\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\n    \\n2.

It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically.

Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}, {'id': 1753903424804905, 'score': 0.6180812, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_42_code', 'type': 'code', 'content': \"#!/usr/bin/env python\\nimport cdsapi\\n \\nc = cdsapi.Client()\\n \\nc.retrieve(\\n    'reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels',\\n    {\\n        'product_type': 'reanalysis',\\n        'variable': 'temperature',\\n        'pressure_level': '1000',\\n        'year': '2021',\\n        'month': '01',\\n        'day': '01',\\n        'time': '12:00',\\n        'format': 'netcdf',                         # NetCDF\\n        'area'          : [60., -11., 34., 35.],    # Default area is global; provide [North, West, South, East] limits to select an area (here selecting Europe)\\n        'grid'          : [1.0, 1.0],               #  Default atmospheric resolution is 0.25 x 0.25; provie [Latitude/longitude] grid resolution to interpolate data to something else.           \\n    },\\n    'output/ERAtest_subarea_1deg1deg.nc')           # Output file.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424357433, 'score': 0.6702195, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_5_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='climatedata'></a>\\n\\n# Working with climate data and climate models\\n\\n### Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)\\n\\n![esgf](img/ESGF_logo.png)\\n\\n\\n[ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov) is an open-source platform that provides distributed access to peta/exa-scale scientific data, **globally**. \\n\\nIt is an interagency and international effort led by the US Department of Energy (DOE), co-funded by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the US National Science Foundation (NSF), and other international partners, such as the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) German Climate Computing Centre (DKRZ), the Australian National University (ANU) National Computational Infrastructure (NCI), Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), and the **Centre for Environmental Data Analysis ([CEDA](https://www.ceda.ac.uk))** in the UK.\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 5}}, {'id': 1753903424623019, 'score': 0.6665864, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_37_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"### Climate Data Operators (CDO)\\nThe Climate Data Operators ([CDO](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo)) software is a collection of >600 operators for standard processing of climate and forecast model data.

The Toolbox is a programming interface. It is free and available to everyone. It links raw data to an online computing facility, thereby removing the computing barrier for users worldwide. The Toolbox allows users to develop python scripts for the CDS and to run them online. The users than then simply download the maps, graph or secondary data without needing to incur the costs associated with storing and maintaining the large climate data archive locally, nor is it required to invest in a powerful computer. \\n\\n\\nThe Toolbox works hand-in-hand with the CDS API. \\n\\nThat is, one can issue commmands to the Toolbox via the CDS API, or develop a python script that does certain things, and then use the CDS API functionality to send it to CDS for evaluation, only to download the finished product locally. \\n\\nExamples of how to proceed are given [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/COPSRV/Call+a+service+with+the+CDS+API). \\n\\nNote, it is also possible to use the CDS Toolbox to plot data from other services (i.e. not originally stored on CDS), using the `remote` function instead of the `service` function. This is possible thanks to protocols such as OPeNDAP. Here is an example using data from UNIDATA. \\n\\nFor illustration of how the Toolbox can be used, the following piece of code, run locally, after the CDS API is properly configured and assuming one is connected to the internet, will produce, and then download to our `output/` directory, a map of global temperature on January 1st 2021 at 14:00.', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 43}}, {'id': 1753903424423297, 'score': 0.649688, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_25_code', 'type': 'code', 'content': '# define the coordinate variables (time, level, lat, lon)\\ntimes = rootgrp.createVariable(\"time\",\"f8\",(\"time\",))\\nlevels = rootgrp.createVariable(\"level\",\"i4\",(\"level\",))\\nlatitudes = rootgrp.createVariable(\"lat\",\"f4\",(\"lat\",))\\nlongitudes = rootgrp.createVariable(\"lon\",\"f4\",(\"lon\",))\\n# new variable \\'temp\\' has 4 dimensions, 2 of which are unlimited (time and level)\\ntemp = rootgrp.createVariable(\"temp\",\"f4\",(\"time\",\"level\",\"lat\",\"lon\",))\\n# we can print a summary of the \\'temp\\' variable\\nprint(temp)\\n\\n# we can also creat a variable inside a group (e.g. in forecasts/model1)\\nftemp = rootgrp.createVariable(\"/forecasts/model1/temp\",\"f4\",(\"time\",\"level\",\"lat\",\"lon\",))\\n# we can also query the status of the group\\nprint(\\'--- model1 ---\\')\\nprint(rootgrp[\"/forecasts/model1\"]) \\n# or the variable in the group directly\\nprint(\\'---model1/temp---\\')\\nprint(rootgrp[\"/forecasts/model1/temp\"])\\n\\n# variables in the Dataset are stored as a python dictionary\\nprint(\\'--- python variable dictionary ---\\')\\nprint(rootgrp.variables)', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 25}}, {'id': 1753903424595753, 'score': 0.64958113, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_40_code', 'type': 'code', 'content': \"#!/usr/bin/env python\\n# \\n# example useage of the CDS API: https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+download+ERA5#HowtodownloadERA5-3-DownloadingonlineERA5familydatathroughtheCDSwebinterface\\n#\\n# Downloading Air Temperature on the 1000 hPa level for a Jan 1st 2021 at 12:00.\\n#\\n\\nimport cdsapi\\n \\nc = cdsapi.Client()\\n \\nc.retrieve(\\n    'reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels',\\n    {\\n        'product_type': 'reanalysis',\\n        'variable': 'temperature',\\n        'pressure_level': '1000',\\n        'year': '2021',\\n        'month': '01',\\n        'day': '01',\\n        'time': '12:00',\\n        'format': 'netcdf',     # NetCDF format\\n    },\\n    'output/ERA5test.nc')       # Output file.

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424804905, 'score': 0.66117096, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_42_code', 'type': 'code', 'content': \"#!/usr/bin/env python\\nimport cdsapi\\n \\nc = cdsapi.Client()\\n \\nc.retrieve(\\n    'reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels',\\n    {\\n        'product_type': 'reanalysis',\\n        'variable': 'temperature',\\n        'pressure_level': '1000',\\n        'year': '2021',\\n        'month': '01',\\n        'day': '01',\\n        'time': '12:00',\\n        'format': 'netcdf',                         # NetCDF\\n        'area'          : [60., -11., 34., 35.],    # Default area is global; provide [North, West, South, East] limits to select an area (here selecting Europe)\\n        'grid'          : [1.0, 1.0],               #  Default atmospheric resolution is 0.25 x 0.25; provie [Latitude/longitude] grid resolution to interpolate data to something else.           \\n    },\\n    'output/ERAtest_subarea_1deg1deg.nc')           # Output file.

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903424595753, 'score': 0.6201765, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_40_code', 'type': 'code', 'content': \"#!/usr/bin/env python\\n# \\n# example useage of the CDS API: https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+download+ERA5#HowtodownloadERA5-3-DownloadingonlineERA5familydatathroughtheCDSwebinterface\\n#\\n# Downloading Air Temperature on the 1000 hPa level for a Jan 1st 2021 at 12:00.\\n#\\n\\nimport cdsapi\\n \\nc = cdsapi.Client()\\n \\nc.retrieve(\\n    'reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels',\\n    {\\n        'product_type': 'reanalysis',\\n        'variable': 'temperature',\\n        'pressure_level': '1000',\\n        'year': '2021',\\n        'month': '01',\\n        'day': '01',\\n        'time': '12:00',\\n        'format': 'netcdf',     # NetCDF format\\n    },\\n    'output/ERA5test.nc')       # Output file.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753903424262111, 'score': 0.6458164, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_38_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='reanalysis'></a>\\n\\n# Reanalysis products\\n\\n![C3S](img/c3s-logo.png)\\n![ECMWF](img/logo-ecmwf.png) \\n\\n[*ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables.

It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753901956917450, 'score': 0.6423516, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_3', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' technology options)\\n\\nUsing climate models: variability(temporal, spatial)\\nImportance of experimental design!Control+ experiment\\nUsing climate models: uncertainties and sensitivities\\nMIP = Model Intercomparison Project\\nEyring et al. 2016\\nUsing climate models: uncertainties and sensitivities\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_ensembleDifferent experimentswith many ensembles!Each one trying to account for sensitivity due to a source of error Real world data: we only have one Earth, ONE realizat', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf', 'chunk_number': 3}}, {'id': 1753902300206271, 'score': 0.63313437, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_0', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'Climate models –what are they?\\n…and different grids for different parts of the model:atmosphere, ocean, land, ice,…\\n\\nA bit of review: What do we need to make a model?(Any model, not necessarily a climate one)\\nWhat does a model need?A very simple analytical exampledCdt=λRequires equations (hypotheses about underlying physics)\\nWhat does a model need?A very simple analytical exampledCdt=λdCCoCf∫=λdttotf∫Cf=λtf−to()−CoRequires initial &boundary conditionsRequires equations (hypotheses about underlyi', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 0}}, {'id': 1753902702944729, 'score': 0.6285626, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_9', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'task.

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}]"

    "response": "The provided context spans several key topics in environmental data analysis, spatial data handling, and reanalysis products like **ERA5**. Below is a structured summary and explanation of the core concepts:\n\n\n- **Definition**: Reanalysis products (e.g., **ERA5**) are model-generated datasets that assimilate historical observations (e.g., satellite, weather stations) to create a consistent, high-resolution representation of the Earth's climate state over time. They are **not direct observations** but rather **model outputs adjusted to match observations**.\n- **Key Features**:\n  - **Assimilation Techniques**: Uses methods like **4D-Var** (four-dimensional variational data assimilation) to align model outputs with observations.\n  - **Temporal Coverage**: ERA5 covers **1950–present** (with updates every 3 months) and includes **uncertainty estimates** for variables.\n  - **Spatial Resolution**: Offers **137 vertical levels** and **80 km height**, with **gridded outputs** (e.g., regular lat/lon grids for ease of use).\n  - **Limitations**: While highly accurate, reanalysis products are still **model-dependent** and subject to computational and physical constraints.\n\n- **Comparison to Observations**:\n  - **Observations** are raw data from sensors (e.g., temperature, wind speed) at specific times and locations.\n  - **Reanalysis** interpolates and fills gaps between observations, providing a **spatially and temporally continuous dataset**.\n\n\n\n- **Grid Types**:\n  - **Native GRIB Format**: Uses the model's original grid (non-regular lat/lon), which can complicate analysis.\n  - **NetCDF Format**: Automatically regridded to **regular lat/lon grids**, simplifying visualization but introducing interpolation-related trade-offs (e.g., loss of conservation properties for certain variables).\n- **Wrap-Around Issue**: \n  - Longitudes are defined as **[0°, 360°]**, meaning the first and last columns of a grid are geographically adjacent. Software must handle this **wrap-around** to avoid errors (e.g., splitting the globe into **[-180°, 180°]**).\n\n- **Importance**: CRS defines how spatial data is projected (e.g., **WGS84** for global datasets). Incorrect CRS can lead to misinterpretation",

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \\n\\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe (\\'18\\' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \\n\\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that\\'s a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \\n\\nAlthough UKCP18 is \\'just\\' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\\n\\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\\n\\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn\\'t contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \\n\\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\\n\\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \\n\\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\\n\\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \\nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \\n\\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \\n\\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \\n\\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \\n\\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\\n3. Output: Data only\\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\\n   \\nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \\n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \\n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \\n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \\n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can\\'t differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \\n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that\\'s a lot of data!).\\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \\n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \\n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \\n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don\\'t close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \\n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \\n\\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\\n\\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \\n\\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we\\'ll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\\n\\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 46}}, {'id': 1753901957273136, 'score': 0.6036686, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_6', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'now –probably lots of good opportunities in that sector!\\n\\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00984-6Fiedler et al. 2021 advocate for a reorganization of climate science highlighting the need for climate projection to be professionalized as an operational service (b)Climate services\\ni.e.the way the field of climate science works will evolve in the next few years\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf', 'chunk_number': 6}}, {'id': 1753903424262111, 'score': 0.60192347, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_38_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='reanalysis'></a>\\n\\n# Reanalysis products\\n\\n![C3S](img/c3s-logo.png)\\n![ECMWF](img/logo-ecmwf.png) \\n\\n[*ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables. The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753901956917450, 'score': 0.60107505, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_3', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' technology options)\\n\\nUsing climate models: variability(temporal, spatial)\\nImportance of experimental design!Control+ experiment\\nUsing climate models: uncertainties and sensitivities\\nMIP = Model Intercomparison Project\\nEyring et al. 2016\\nUsing climate models: uncertainties and sensitivities\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_ensembleDifferent experimentswith many ensembles!Each one trying to account for sensitivity due to a source of error Real world data: we only have one Earth, ONE realizat', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf', 'chunk_number': 3}}]",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

The Toolbox is a programming interface. It is free and available to everyone. It links raw data to an online computing facility, thereby removing the computing barrier for users worldwide. The Toolbox allows users to develop python scripts for the CDS and to run them online. The users than then simply download the maps, graph or secondary data without needing to incur the costs associated with storing and maintaining the large climate data archive locally, nor is it required to invest in a powerful computer. \\n\\n\\nThe Toolbox works hand-in-hand with the CDS API. \\n\\nThat is, one can issue commmands to the Toolbox via the CDS API, or develop a python script that does certain things, and then use the CDS API functionality to send it to CDS for evaluation, only to download the finished product locally. \\n\\nExamples of how to proceed are given [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/COPSRV/Call+a+service+with+the+CDS+API). \\n\\nNote, it is also possible to use the CDS Toolbox to plot data from other services (i.e. not originally stored on CDS), using the `remote` function instead of the `service` function. This is possible thanks to protocols such as OPeNDAP. Here is an example using data from UNIDATA. \\n\\nFor illustration of how the Toolbox can be used, the following piece of code, run locally, after the CDS API is properly configured and assuming one is connected to the internet, will produce, and then download to our `output/` directory, a map of global temperature on January 1st 2021 at 14:00.', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 43}}, {'id': 1753903424143550, 'score': 0.6739523, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_11_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='NetCDF'></a>\\n\\n## Network Common Data Form (NetCDF)\\n\\n[NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) is one of the most common data format used to store climate data. NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\\n\\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \\n\\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\\n\\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\\n\\n\\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)). [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu) also manages [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu), one of the first center to have developped climate models and is today one of the gold-standard on the topic. \\n\\nNCAR also developed [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu), an interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization (we will not use NCL here, but the python package `ESMValTool` has build-in support for it). \\n\\n[NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu) has also developped the [climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu), a tool to search and access >200 data sets specific to the ocean, land and the atmosphere.

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention.

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}]"

It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}]",

It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424509295, 'score': 0.64064467, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 01- Introduction to climate data and climate models\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n## Contents\\n- [Lectures](#lectures)\\n- [Question](#question)\\n- [ESMValTool](#ESMValTool)\\n- [Sources of climate data](#climatedata)\\n- [CEDA](#CEDA)\\n- [File formats](#fileformat)\\n- [Metadata](#metadata)\\n- [NetCDF](#NetCDF)\\n- [NCO](#NCO)\\n- [Reanalysis products](#reanalysis)\\n- [Climate services UKCP18](#ukcp18)\\n  \\n## Learning outcomes\\n1.

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903425044501, 'score': 0.600899, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_47_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '### Looking at the data\\n\\nNow take a look at the downloaded data. \\n\\nYou should see folders with the following format (`output_<some string>`): \\n```\\noutput_08b295c097368efd78f0c78b53b320d7_20211114_234836/\\noutput_1819e6a692e9503460dcf1416043a7c2_20211114_231924/\\n```\\n\\nLooking in these folders, we see 4 files: \\n```\\n>>> ls output_08b295c097368efd78f0c78b53b320d7_20211114_234837\\n\\n2021-11-14T23-44-34.nc\\ndata_licence.txt\\ninput_paths.txt\\nrequest.txt\\n```\\n`input_path.txt` shows the path on the CEDA archive from where the data were obtained.

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}]",

The degree of influence that a point has on another point (i.e. the memory) is specified by means of a covariance matrix.

Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\\n\\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \\n\\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\\\left(1-exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-h}{ra}\\\\right)\\\\right)+n_{(0,\\\\infty)}\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\n    \\n2. Gaussian semivariogram model\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\\\left(1-exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{h^2}{a^2}\\\\right)\\\\right)+n_{(0,\\\\infty)}\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\n  \\n3. Spherical semivariogram model\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\n  \\\\gamma(h) =\\n  \\\\begin{cases}\\n    (s-n)\\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\frac{h}{a}-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left( \\\\frac{h}{a}\\\\right)^3 \\\\right)+n_{(0,\\\\infty)} & \\\\text{for }h\\\\le a,\\\\\\\\\\n    (s-n) & \\\\text{for }h > a.\\n  \\\\end{cases}\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\n\\n\\nIn the functions above, $h$ is distance. $s$ is called the `sill`, the value that $\\\\gamma(h)$ tends to as h goes to $\\\\infty$. $r$ is the `range`, or the distance at which the difference $\\\\gamma(h)-s$ becomes negligible. $n$ is called the `nugget` parameter. It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data.

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753905536862783, 'score': 0.62257147, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_timeseriesanalysis.ipynb_cell_5_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='practice'></a>\\n## Practicing with stationarity and detrending\\n\\nAs an example, let's first create a few synthetic time series, using a `random walk` model, i.e. a sequence of random points, with a given variance, but that are uncorrelated from point to point.

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902702662417, 'score': 0.6004574, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_10', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ls that are ‘fitted’ to data•Some model parameters are tuned to fit–Question is what to fit/how?

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902702944729, 'score': 0.62321895, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_9', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'task.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

The answer will depend on any additional constraints that one applies on these weights and on any additional properties one wishes the field $F$ or $D$ to have (stationarity of various moments, isotropy, etc.). Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}, {'id': 1753905537290559, 'score': 0.6243286, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_timeseriesanalysis.ipynb_cell_26_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='MA'></a>\\n### MA(q) (Moving Average Models)\\n\\n[Moving average (MA(q)) model](https://otexts.com/fpp2/MA.html) use past errors in the model to predict future values.

The \"order\" $ q $ indicates how many lagged errors are included.\n  - Equation:  \n    $$\n    X_t = \\mu + \\epsilon_t + \\sum_{i=1}^{q} \\theta_i \\epsilon_{t-i}\n    $$\n    - $ \\mu $: Mean of the series (often set to 0 for detrended data).  \n    - $ \\epsilon_t $: White noise (random errors).  \n    - $ \\theta_i $: Parameters to be estimated.  \n\n- **Short Memory**: MA models are called \"short memory\" because errors from more than $ q $ steps ago do not influence current predictions.  \n- **Example**:  \n  - MA(1):  \n    $$\n    X_t = \\mu + \\epsilon_t + \\theta_1 \\epsilon_{t-1}\n    $$\n\n\n- **Components**:  \n  - **AR(p)**: Autoregressive terms (use past values).  \n  - **I(d)**: Integrated terms (difference the data $ d $ times to achieve stationarity).  \n  - **MA(q)**: Moving average terms (use past errors).  \n- **Purpose**: ARIMA extends AR and MA models to handle **non-stationary** data by differencing (integration).  \n- **Example**:  \n  - ARIMA(1,1,1) combines AR(1), I(1), and MA(1) components.  \n\n\n- **Definition**: A time series is stationary if its **mean, variance, and autocorrelation** are constant over time.  \n- **Why It Matters**: Most time series models (e.g., AR, MA, ARIMA) assume stationarity. Non-stationary data must be **differenced** (integration) to achieve stationarity.  \n- **Checking Stationarity**:  \n  - Visual inspection (e.g., trend, seasonality).  \n  - Statistical tests (e.g., KPSS, ADF tests).  \n\n\n- **ARMA(p,q)**: Combines autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components.  \n  -",

The big question is what values should the weight corresponding to each sample have? Answering this question is not easy - it is basically the whole point of kriging. The answer will depend on any additional constraints that one applies on these weights and on any additional properties one wishes the field $F$ or $D$ to have (stationarity of various moments, isotropy, etc.). Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}, {'id': 1753902702991543, 'score': 0.607794, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_2', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'ess fundamental conservation properties (mass, momentum, energy) that arm-wavy arguments do not have(It’s much easier to explain data with arm-wavy arguments)(…but models can provide means to test hypotheses)3.Models can be wrong in many different ways(figuring out why they are wrong is where learning occurs)(data come in to inform parameterizations and testing simulations)4.The skill of a “modeler/analyst” is less in knowing how to model (i.emath, computer science) and more in how to make usefu', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf', 'chunk_number': 2}}]",

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753902300206271, 'score': 0.62042606, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_0', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'Climate models –what are they?\\n…and different grids for different parts of the model:atmosphere, ocean, land, ice,…\\n\\nA bit of review: What do we need to make a model?(Any model, not necessarily a climate one)\\nWhat does a model need?A very simple analytical exampledCdt=λRequires equations (hypotheses about underlying physics)\\nWhat does a model need?A very simple analytical exampledCdt=λdCCoCf∫=λdttotf∫Cf=λtf−to()−CoRequires initial &boundary conditionsRequires equations (hypotheses about underlyi', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 0}}, {'id': 1753901956917450, 'score': 0.6194719, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf_chunk_3', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' technology options)\\n\\nUsing climate models: variability(temporal, spatial)\\nImportance of experimental design!Control+ experiment\\nUsing climate models: uncertainties and sensitivities\\nMIP = Model Intercomparison Project\\nEyring et al. 2016\\nUsing climate models: uncertainties and sensitivities\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_ensembleDifferent experimentswith many ensembles!Each one trying to account for sensitivity due to a source of error Real world data: we only have one Earth, ONE realizat', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\01v1_Why_climate_data.pdf', 'chunk_number': 3}}, {'id': 1753903424143550, 'score': 0.6180315, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_11_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='NetCDF'></a>\\n\\n## Network Common Data Form (NetCDF)\\n\\n[NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) is one of the most common data format used to store climate data.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

Metadata are not the data themselves, but are required to provide context and therefore inform the data analysis.** \\n\\nThere are two types of metadata, \"**discover metadata**\", which can be used to locate the dataset in a search, and \"**detailed metadata**\", which contain the information necessary to use the data (ideally) without having to ask the data provider for more information (even if one of the key piece of information should be the data provider information and contact detail!).\\n\\nThere is no upper limit as to what information should be included in the metadata, but typical metadata comprise information about when and where the observations, or the file, where produced, how they were produced (which instrument, technique, algorithm were used), information about the experiment the data come from, maybe some information about data accuracy (if not provided as seperate data in the file), information about who produced the data or the file, including contact information, or appropriate reference(s), and, if relevant, additional information about the research context, i.e. which project is associated with these data (this could help the user understand if more data from this group/project exist or can be expected). If the data represent a subset of a larger dataset, this should also be mentioned. \\n\\nAnother key pieces of information that the metadata should provide are a description of the variables in the file, with variable **names**, and the **units** of these variables. \\n\\nIf the data in the file represent a processed version of other raw data, then one should add information about these raw data as well, their provenance, references, and the transformation that was made, etc. One should be able to track the chain of information all the way to the orginal observations (or model output). \\n\\nIf the data represent gridded variables, then the nature of the grid on which these data are defined should also be explained. \\n\\nSimilarly, if the position, or some other features of the data, depend on a reference system, that reference system should be given. This will be discussed in more depth during the introduction to geostatistics lecture. \\n\\nIn the case of climate models (or other models, if relevant), the metadata should also include information about the model itself, the model name, version, the length of the integration, maybe a brief description of the spin-up, boundary conditions, initial conditions used to produce the simulation. \\n\\nObviously the information that will be included in the metadata vary substantially. You should learn (and will discover - mostly through shear frustration when key information is missing!) what constitute useful metadata in your field of work. \\n\\nMetadata can be included in the file itself (if the file format allows it), as separate files, or in the form of some other documents. When sourcing data, always make a note of where the data come from. This is especially true if getting data online as it is very easy to download data and then forget where they come from. Detailed note-taking is part of the job of the data analyst (and that of any scientist!). \\n\\nWhen metadata is included in the file directly, this typically comes as a header, or in a specified location in the file. The netCDF format has rules for how/where to include metadata, which is one of the reason why netCDF data are particularly useful and popular in climate science. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 9}}, {'id': 1753903424179424, 'score': 0.6055872, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_18_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': 'One can also use `Dataset` to read existing files.

If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\\n\\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \\n\\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement. The contoured estimate will tend to either over or underestimate the true value, within a tolerance controlled by the noise associated with the measurements. \\n\\nThe shape of the fitted surface will depend strongly on the data available: their locations, their uncertainties, as well as subjective choices made during the analysis (i.e. definition of the so-called 'covariance matrix').\\n\\nWe will here look at a technique called **kriging**, pioneered by a South African mining engineer called Danie G. Krige (1919-2013) and further formalized by geologist and mathematician Georges Matheron (1930-2000), who, together with Jean Serra, is often considered to be the founder of geostatistics.\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 21}}, {'id': 1753903968084902, 'score': 0.63488805, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='spatial'></a>\\n# Analysis of spatial data\\n\\nSo far in this class, we have mostly considered the analysis of data-series from single locations, where some property is measured repeadedly in time, or data that came already gridded in easy to use format. \\n\\nHowever, often in environmental sciences, we are faced with a different or additional problem; that is one will have to either make sense of many single measurements dispersed in space or even with multiple time-series dispersed in space. \\n\\nThe problem of making sense of spatially dispersed data is often linked to the problem of `contouring`. Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753902703475561, 'score': 0.6340059, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\03v1_Common_issues.pdf_chunk_11', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'uction, what does “right” even mean?•What do we do if one model can represent a variable better but another variable worst?•A model can reproduce the mean state well but not the variability.

Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\\n\\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \\n\\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\\\left(1-exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-h}{ra}\\\\right)\\\\right)+n_{(0,\\\\infty)}\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\n    \\n2.

It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\\n\\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\\n\\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\\n\\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\\n\\n\\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$. At this point, one can either compute the **spatial covariance**\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nC(k \\\\Delta h)=\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k\\\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nfrom which we can compute the **correlogram**, which is simply the spatial covariance normalized by the data variance (at $k=0$) so as to limit its range to $\\\\pm 1$,\\n\\n\\\\label{eq:corelogram}\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\rho(k \\\\Delta  h)=\\\\frac{C(k \\\\Delta h)}{C(0)}=\\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k \\\\Delta  h)d(x_i)}{\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^m(d(x_i)^2)}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nor look at the mean squared difference and form the **semivariogram**\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\gamma(k \\\\Delta  h)=\\\\frac{1}{2m}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^m\\\\left(d(x_i+k\\\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\\\right)^2.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nThe functional forms $C(h)$, $\\\\rho(h)$ or $\\\\gamma(h)$ of these binned, discrete estimates is obtained simply by plotting $C(k\\\\Delta h)$, $\\\\rho(k\\\\Delta  h)$ or $\\\\gamma(k\\\\Delta  h)$ as a function of $k\\\\Delta h$ and by fitting a polynomial throught the results that ensures strictly positive values of $C(h)$, $\\\\rho(h)$ or $\\\\gamma(h)$ for any $h$.\\n\\nNote that the corelogram in geostatistics is very similar to the autocorrelation function used in time-series analysis. Indeed, as the lag-distance increases, both $\\\\rho(h)$ and $C(h)$ decrease, while $\\\\gamma(h)$ increases.\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 24}}]",

    "response": "The provided context highlights critical aspects of climate data analysis, model limitations, and the challenges of interpreting climate simulations. Here's a structured summary of key insights:\n\n- **Data Limitations**: Climate data often has inherent uncertainties due to measurement errors, environmental variability, and incomplete observational records. For example, cloud microphysics in models remains poorly understood, affecting predictions of rainfall events.\n- **Statistical Tools**: Analysis strategies must account for data types, distribution constraints, and the strengths/limitations of statistical and modeling tools. Uncertainties must be characterized comprehensively, including measurement errors and environmental dynamics.\n\n- **Model Limitations**: No model is perfect. Factors like resolution (high vs. low), parameterizations (e.g., cloud physics), and boundary conditions introduce errors. For instance, high-resolution models capture local extremes but require more computational resources.\n- **Ensemble Simulations**: Ensemble runs (e.g., 100+ simulations) help quantify uncertainties. Averaged results (e.g., surface temperature anomalies) provide better insights than single runs, but interpreting ensemble outputs requires care to avoid overconfidence in results.\n\n- **Observational Data**: Real-world data is limited to one \"Earth realization,\" making direct comparisons with models challenging. Reanalysis products (models assimilated with observations) bridge this gap but still face limitations.\n- **Experimental Design**: The choice of models, simulations, and analysis methods must align with the scientific question. For example, simpler models may suffice for basic analyses, while complex models are needed for detailed process studies.\n\n- **Resolution Trade-offs**: Higher resolution improves local predictions but increases computational costs. Lower resolution models may simulate longer timeframes with many ensembles, balancing accuracy and feasibility.\n- **Internal vs. Forced Responses**: Models must distinguish between natural variability (internal dynamics) and responses to external forcings (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions). This distinction is critical for attributing climate changes to specific causes.\n- **Skill of the Analyst**: Interpreting model outputs requires expertise to avoid overreaching conclusions. Analysts must balance model complexity with the question's requirements, leveraging experimental design to minimize biases.\n\n- **Synthetic Data Examples**: Tools like random walk models or seasonal cycles help test stationarity and detrending techniques in time series analysis.\n- **Observational System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs)**: These experiments simulate observational data to evaluate model performance and improve data assimilation techniques (e.g., 4DVAR).\n\nClimate models are indispensable tools, but their utility depends on acknowledging their limitations and using them judiciously. Combining model outputs with observational data, leveraging ensemble methods, and prioritizing transparency in uncertainty analysis are essential for meaningful climate research. The goal is not perfection but practicality—ensuring models are as useful as possible within their constraints.",
