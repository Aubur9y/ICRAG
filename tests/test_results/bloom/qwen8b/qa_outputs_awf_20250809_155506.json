UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \\n\\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe (\\'18\\' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \\n\\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that\\'s a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \\n\\nAlthough UKCP18 is \\'just\\' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\\n\\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\\n\\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn\\'t contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \\n\\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\\n\\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \\n\\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\\n\\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \\nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \\n\\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \\n\\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \\n\\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \\n\\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\\n3. Output: Data only\\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\\n   \\nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \\n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \\n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \\n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \\n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can\\'t differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \\n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that\\'s a lot of data!).\\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \\n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \\n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \\n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don\\'t close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \\n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \\n\\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\\n\\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \\n\\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we\\'ll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\\n\\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 46}}, {'id': 1753902299806645, 'score': 0.6588308, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_2', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' problem under study, etc.\\nWhat does a model need?A very simple numerical exampledCdt=λCCi+1−Citi+1−ti=λCiCi+1=Ci1+λΔt()dCdt=limΔt→0C(t+Δt)−C(t)ΔtRequires discretization of derivativesand numerical integration to step forward from tito tf=NDTForward difference(aka Forward Euler)[climatemodelsusemuchmorecomplex schemes]\\nii+1\\nWhat does a model need?Discretization needed to implement numericallydCdt=λCCi+1−CiΔt=λCi+1Ci+1=λΔtCi+1+CiCi+1=Ci11−λΔtBackward difference(aka backward Euler)Requires solving', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 2}}]",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753902299806645, 'score': 0.6731294, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_2', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': ' problem under study, etc.\\nWhat does a model need?A very simple numerical exampledCdt=λCCi+1−Citi+1−ti=λCiCi+1=Ci1+λΔt()dCdt=limΔt→0C(t+Δt)−C(t)ΔtRequires discretization of derivativesand numerical integration to step forward from tito tf=NDTForward difference(aka Forward Euler)[climatemodelsusemuchmorecomplex schemes]\\nii+1\\nWhat does a model need?Discretization needed to implement numericallydCdt=λCCi+1−CiΔt=λCi+1Ci+1=λΔtCi+1+CiCi+1=Ci11−λΔtBackward difference(aka backward Euler)Requires solving', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 2}}, {'id': 1753903424509295, 'score': 0.6726559, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 01- Introduction to climate data and climate models\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n## Contents\\n- [Lectures](#lectures)\\n- [Question](#question)\\n- [ESMValTool](#ESMValTool)\\n- [Sources of climate data](#climatedata)\\n- [CEDA](#CEDA)\\n- [File formats](#fileformat)\\n- [Metadata](#metadata)\\n- [NetCDF](#NetCDF)\\n- [NCO](#NCO)\\n- [Reanalysis products](#reanalysis)\\n- [Climate services UKCP18](#ukcp18)\\n  \\n## Learning outcomes\\n1.

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \\n\\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe (\\'18\\' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \\n\\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that\\'s a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \\n\\nAlthough UKCP18 is \\'just\\' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\\n\\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\\n\\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn\\'t contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \\n\\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\\n\\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \\n\\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\\n\\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \\nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \\n\\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \\n\\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \\n\\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \\n\\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\\n3. Output: Data only\\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\\n   \\nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \\n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \\n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \\n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \\n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can\\'t differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \\n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that\\'s a lot of data!).\\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \\n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \\n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \\n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don\\'t close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \\n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \\n\\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\\n\\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \\n\\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we\\'ll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\\n\\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 46}}]",

[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}]",

    "response": "Here's a structured summary of the key concepts and challenges related to **climate models**, **data assimilation**, and **model-data comparison** from the provided documents:\n\n\n- **Equations and Hypotheses**: Models rely on equations derived from physical laws (e.g., fluid dynamics, thermodynamics) to simulate atmospheric, oceanic, and land processes. These equations are often solved numerically due to their complexity.\n- **Discretization**: Continuous equations are approximated using discrete grids (spatial and temporal). Choices like grid resolution (Dx, Dy, Dz), time steps (Dt), and numerical schemes (e.g., Forward/Backward Euler) impact accuracy and computational cost.\n- **Coupling**: Models integrate multiple components (atmosphere, ocean, land, ice) with exchanges of heat, water, momentum, and energy. Challenges include mismatched grids and nonlinear feedbacks (e.g., teleconnections).\n\n\n- **Cloud Microphysics**: \n  - Cloud formation and precipitation processes are poorly understood at the scale of grid cells (much larger than cloud physics scales).\n  - This leads to uncertainties in predicting rain events and their spatial/temporal distribution.\n- **Data Assimilation**: \n  - Techniques like **4DVAR** (Four-Dimensional Variational Assimilation) are used to integrate observational data into models.\n  - **Observational System Simulation Experiments (OSSE)** help test model performance by simulating \"observations\" from models.\n- **Model Limitations**: \n  - All models are inherently \"wrong\" and \"incomplete\" due to simplifications, unquantified effects (e.g., \"Z\" influencing \"W\"), and parameterization of sub-grid processes.\n  - Reanalysis products (e.g., ERA5) combine models with observations to create consistent historical datasets.\n\n\n- **Data Points vs. Model Outputs**: \n  - Observations (data points) are compared to model results at specific locations and times. Challenges include spatial/temporal resolution mismatches.\n  - **Reanalysis products** bridge this gap by assimilating real-world data into models.\n- **Experimental Design**: \n  - Control experiments (baseline scenarios) and perturbations (e.g., CO₂ changes) are used to study sensitivities and uncertainties.\n  - **Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs)** like CMIP6 standardize experiments to",

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753903424815332, 'score': 0.7004942, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_6_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '<a id=\\'CEDA\\'></a>\\n\\n### For the UK: Center for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA)\\n\\n![ceda](img/ceda_archive_logo_transp_white_3_h80.png)\\n\\n[CEDA](https://www.ceda.ac.uk) serves the UK environmental science community. It is a component of ESGF. \\n\\nCEDA has two main branches: \\n1. [CEDA-Archive: https://archive.ceda.ac.uk](https://archive.ceda.ac.uk) \\n2. [JASMIN: https://jasmin.ac.uk](https://jasmin.ac.uk)\\n\\n[CEDA-Archive](https://archive.ceda.ac.uk) serves as the national (UK) data centre for atmospheric and earth observation research. It currently holds >18 Petabytes of atmospheric and earth observation data from a variet of sources, such as aircraft campaigns, satellites imagery, automatic weather stations, climate models, etc. \\n\\nCEDA is one of 5 UK data centers, comprising the Environmental Data Service ([EDS](https://nerc.ukri.org/research/sites/environmental-data-service-eds/)), supported by the UK Research and Innovation\\'s National Environmental Research Council (NERC). The 5 centers are \\n1. British Oceanographic Data Centre (Marine), \\n2. CEDA (Atmospheric, Earth Observation, and Solar and space physics), \\n3. Environmental Information Data Centre (Terrestrial and freshwater), \\n4. National Geoscience Data Centre (Geoscience), and \\n5. Polar Data Centre (Polar and cryosphere). \\n   \\nAs the focus is on climate here, CEDA is the most relevant, but it is useful to know of these resources if you end up working in other fields. \\n\\nCEDA also serves as the Data Distribution Center ([DDC](https://www.ipcc-data.org)) for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch)).\\n\\n[JASMIN](https://jasmin.ac.uk) is a data intensive supercomputer for environmental science. It currently supports over 160 projects ranging from climate science and oceanography to air pollution, earthquake deformation or biodiversity studies. JASMIN consists of multi-Petabyte fast storage, co-located with data analysis computing facilities. This would be the \"go-to\" tool for processing large amounts of climate data, which are directly linked to the system (through CEDA). We will here work offline (using local storage), but JASMIN and CEDA are useful resources for anyone working in environmental science in the UK (most nations don\\'t have these facilities - they are rare and valuable!). \\n\\nSince CEDA and JASMIN are linked, the **compute power is linked to the data**, making for an efficient environment for data analysis. \\n\\n#### Getting access\\n\\nObviously, maintaining these facilities has a cost and therefore not all users will have the same access priviledges. Members of educational, academic and research institutions in the UK can often access these infrastructures for free (pending one can demonstrate need and subject to a fair-use policy). Use and access will likely not be free for commercial applications.  \\n\\n**Use your Imperial College London email adresses (or from another UK institution) to register!**\\n\\nIn order to use the CEDA-Archive, it is necessary to first [register for an account](https://services.ceda.ac.uk/cedasite/register/info/). This is generally quick, easy and free.\\n\\nSimilarly, access to JASMIN requires an account, but this involves a more complex multi-step process. First, one must ask for a [JASMIN portal account](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4435-get-a-jasmin-account). If granted, one can then register for a [jasmin-login account] (https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/161-get-login-account). The type of account given will depend on need and priviledges requested. Users granted jasmin-login access get a HOME directory of 100GB of storage and can access the shared JASMIN servers (Scientific servers, data transfer servers, and the LOTUS HPC cluster).\\n   \\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 6}}, {'id': 1753903424509295, 'score': 0.6969757, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 01- Introduction to climate data and climate models\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n## Contents\\n- [Lectures](#lectures)\\n- [Question](#question)\\n- [ESMValTool](#ESMValTool)\\n- [Sources of climate data](#climatedata)\\n- [CEDA](#CEDA)\\n- [File formats](#fileformat)\\n- [Metadata](#metadata)\\n- [NetCDF](#NetCDF)\\n- [NCO](#NCO)\\n- [Reanalysis products](#reanalysis)\\n- [Climate services UKCP18](#ukcp18)\\n  \\n## Learning outcomes\\n1.

Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\\n\\nYou\\'ll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \\n\\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \\n\\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \\n\\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

Metadata are not the data themselves, but are required to provide context and therefore inform the data analysis.** \\n\\nThere are two types of metadata, \"**discover metadata**\", which can be used to locate the dataset in a search, and \"**detailed metadata**\", which contain the information necessary to use the data (ideally) without having to ask the data provider for more information (even if one of the key piece of information should be the data provider information and contact detail!).\\n\\nThere is no upper limit as to what information should be included in the metadata, but typical metadata comprise information about when and where the observations, or the file, where produced, how they were produced (which instrument, technique, algorithm were used), information about the experiment the data come from, maybe some information about data accuracy (if not provided as seperate data in the file), information about who produced the data or the file, including contact information, or appropriate reference(s), and, if relevant, additional information about the research context, i.e. which project is associated with these data (this could help the user understand if more data from this group/project exist or can be expected). If the data represent a subset of a larger dataset, this should also be mentioned. \\n\\nAnother key pieces of information that the metadata should provide are a description of the variables in the file, with variable **names**, and the **units** of these variables. \\n\\nIf the data in the file represent a processed version of other raw data, then one should add information about these raw data as well, their provenance, references, and the transformation that was made, etc. One should be able to track the chain of information all the way to the orginal observations (or model output). \\n\\nIf the data represent gridded variables, then the nature of the grid on which these data are defined should also be explained. \\n\\nSimilarly, if the position, or some other features of the data, depend on a reference system, that reference system should be given. This will be discussed in more depth during the introduction to geostatistics lecture. \\n\\nIn the case of climate models (or other models, if relevant), the metadata should also include information about the model itself, the model name, version, the length of the integration, maybe a brief description of the spin-up, boundary conditions, initial conditions used to produce the simulation. \\n\\nObviously the information that will be included in the metadata vary substantially. You should learn (and will discover - mostly through shear frustration when key information is missing!) what constitute useful metadata in your field of work. \\n\\nMetadata can be included in the file itself (if the file format allows it), as separate files, or in the form of some other documents. When sourcing data, always make a note of where the data come from. This is especially true if getting data online as it is very easy to download data and then forget where they come from. Detailed note-taking is part of the job of the data analyst (and that of any scientist!). \\n\\nWhen metadata is included in the file directly, this typically comes as a header, or in a specified location in the file. The netCDF format has rules for how/where to include metadata, which is one of the reason why netCDF data are particularly useful and popular in climate science. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 9}}]",

Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\\n\\nYou\\'ll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \\n\\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \\n\\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \\n\\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study.

As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753903424959234, 'score': 0.69783413, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_9_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '<a id=\\'Metadata\\'></a>\\n\\n## The importance of Metadata\\n[Metadata](https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/4428-metadata-basics) **relate to all the information necessary to interpret, understand and use a given dataset.

It is a component of ESGF. \\n\\nCEDA has two main branches: \\n1. [CEDA-Archive: https://archive.ceda.ac.uk](https://archive.ceda.ac.uk) \\n2. [JASMIN: https://jasmin.ac.uk](https://jasmin.ac.uk)\\n\\n[CEDA-Archive](https://archive.ceda.ac.uk) serves as the national (UK) data centre for atmospheric and earth observation research. It currently holds >18 Petabytes of atmospheric and earth observation data from a variet of sources, such as aircraft campaigns, satellites imagery, automatic weather stations, climate models, etc. \\n\\nCEDA is one of 5 UK data centers, comprising the Environmental Data Service ([EDS](https://nerc.ukri.org/research/sites/environmental-data-service-eds/)), supported by the UK Research and Innovation\\'s National Environmental Research Council (NERC). The 5 centers are \\n1. British Oceanographic Data Centre (Marine), \\n2. CEDA (Atmospheric, Earth Observation, and Solar and space physics), \\n3. Environmental Information Data Centre (Terrestrial and freshwater), \\n4. National Geoscience Data Centre (Geoscience), and \\n5. Polar Data Centre (Polar and cryosphere). \\n   \\nAs the focus is on climate here, CEDA is the most relevant, but it is useful to know of these resources if you end up working in other fields. \\n\\nCEDA also serves as the Data Distribution Center ([DDC](https://www.ipcc-data.org)) for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch)).\\n\\n[JASMIN](https://jasmin.ac.uk) is a data intensive supercomputer for environmental science. It currently supports over 160 projects ranging from climate science and oceanography to air pollution, earthquake deformation or biodiversity studies. JASMIN consists of multi-Petabyte fast storage, co-located with data analysis computing facilities. This would be the \"go-to\" tool for processing large amounts of climate data, which are directly linked to the system (through CEDA). We will here work offline (using local storage), but JASMIN and CEDA are useful resources for anyone working in environmental science in the UK (most nations don\\'t have these facilities - they are rare and valuable!). \\n\\nSince CEDA and JASMIN are linked, the **compute power is linked to the data**, making for an efficient environment for data analysis. \\n\\n#### Getting access\\n\\nObviously, maintaining these facilities has a cost and therefore not all users will have the same access priviledges. Members of educational, academic and research institutions in the UK can often access these infrastructures for free (pending one can demonstrate need and subject to a fair-use policy). Use and access will likely not be free for commercial applications.  \\n\\n**Use your Imperial College London email adresses (or from another UK institution) to register!**\\n\\nIn order to use the CEDA-Archive, it is necessary to first [register for an account](https://services.ceda.ac.uk/cedasite/register/info/). This is generally quick, easy and free.\\n\\nSimilarly, access to JASMIN requires an account, but this involves a more complex multi-step process. First, one must ask for a [JASMIN portal account](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4435-get-a-jasmin-account).

The Toolbox is a programming interface. It is free and available to everyone. It links raw data to an online computing facility, thereby removing the computing barrier for users worldwide. The Toolbox allows users to develop python scripts for the CDS and to run them online. The users than then simply download the maps, graph or secondary data without needing to incur the costs associated with storing and maintaining the large climate data archive locally, nor is it required to invest in a powerful computer. \\n\\n\\nThe Toolbox works hand-in-hand with the CDS API. \\n\\nThat is, one can issue commmands to the Toolbox via the CDS API, or develop a python script that does certain things, and then use the CDS API functionality to send it to CDS for evaluation, only to download the finished product locally. \\n\\nExamples of how to proceed are given [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/COPSRV/Call+a+service+with+the+CDS+API). \\n\\nNote, it is also possible to use the CDS Toolbox to plot data from other services (i.e. not originally stored on CDS), using the `remote` function instead of the `service` function. This is possible thanks to protocols such as OPeNDAP. Here is an example using data from UNIDATA. \\n\\nFor illustration of how the Toolbox can be used, the following piece of code, run locally, after the CDS API is properly configured and assuming one is connected to the internet, will produce, and then download to our `output/` directory, a map of global temperature on January 1st 2021 at 14:00.', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 43}}, {'id': 1753903424142956, 'score': 0.71599776, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_4_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='ESMValTool'></a>\\n\\n# Python environments to consider for working with climate data \\n\\n* ## Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool)\\n![esmvaltool](img/ESMValTool-logo-2.png)\\n\\nThis week, it should be possible to simply install packages as needed...\\n\\nHowever, if you anticipate possible future needs, you may want to invest a bit of effort to setup a specific python environment to work with climate data. If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \\n\\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \\n\\n[back to contents](##Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 4}}, {'id': 1753903424243022, 'score': 0.70612186, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_10_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \" * ### The Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions (prominent in climate science)\\n \\nGiven the amount of data produced keeps increasing, data libraries are being developed. As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\\n\\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753903424509295, 'score': 0.70348763, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 01- Introduction to climate data and climate models\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n## Contents\\n- [Lectures](#lectures)\\n- [Question](#question)\\n- [ESMValTool](#ESMValTool)\\n- [Sources of climate data](#climatedata)\\n- [CEDA](#CEDA)\\n- [File formats](#fileformat)\\n- [Metadata](#metadata)\\n- [NetCDF](#NetCDF)\\n- [NCO](#NCO)\\n- [Reanalysis products](#reanalysis)\\n- [Climate services UKCP18](#ukcp18)\\n  \\n## Learning outcomes\\n1.

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\\n\\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \\n\\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\\\*not\\\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \\n\\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \\n\\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\\n\\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \\n\\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \\n\\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 38}}, {'id': 1753903424623019, 'score': 0.67046374, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_37_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"### Climate Data Operators (CDO)\\nThe Climate Data Operators ([CDO](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo)) software is a collection of >600 operators for standard processing of climate and forecast model data.

Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\\n\\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \\n\\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\\n\\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \\n\\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \\n\\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 10}}, {'id': 1753903424509295, 'score': 0.71271193, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_1_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 01- Introduction to climate data and climate models\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n## Contents\\n- [Lectures](#lectures)\\n- [Question](#question)\\n- [ESMValTool](#ESMValTool)\\n- [Sources of climate data](#climatedata)\\n- [CEDA](#CEDA)\\n- [File formats](#fileformat)\\n- [Metadata](#metadata)\\n- [NetCDF](#NetCDF)\\n- [NCO](#NCO)\\n- [Reanalysis products](#reanalysis)\\n- [Climate services UKCP18](#ukcp18)\\n  \\n## Learning outcomes\\n1.

Metadata are not the data themselves, but are required to provide context and therefore inform the data analysis.** \\n\\nThere are two types of metadata, \"**discover metadata**\", which can be used to locate the dataset in a search, and \"**detailed metadata**\", which contain the information necessary to use the data (ideally) without having to ask the data provider for more information (even if one of the key piece of information should be the data provider information and contact detail!).\\n\\nThere is no upper limit as to what information should be included in the metadata, but typical metadata comprise information about when and where the observations, or the file, where produced, how they were produced (which instrument, technique, algorithm were used), information about the experiment the data come from, maybe some information about data accuracy (if not provided as seperate data in the file), information about who produced the data or the file, including contact information, or appropriate reference(s), and, if relevant, additional information about the research context, i.e. which project is associated with these data (this could help the user understand if more data from this group/project exist or can be expected). If the data represent a subset of a larger dataset, this should also be mentioned. \\n\\nAnother key pieces of information that the metadata should provide are a description of the variables in the file, with variable **names**, and the **units** of these variables. \\n\\nIf the data in the file represent a processed version of other raw data, then one should add information about these raw data as well, their provenance, references, and the transformation that was made, etc. One should be able to track the chain of information all the way to the orginal observations (or model output). \\n\\nIf the data represent gridded variables, then the nature of the grid on which these data are defined should also be explained. \\n\\nSimilarly, if the position, or some other features of the data, depend on a reference system, that reference system should be given. This will be discussed in more depth during the introduction to geostatistics lecture. \\n\\nIn the case of climate models (or other models, if relevant), the metadata should also include information about the model itself, the model name, version, the length of the integration, maybe a brief description of the spin-up, boundary conditions, initial conditions used to produce the simulation. \\n\\nObviously the information that will be included in the metadata vary substantially. You should learn (and will discover - mostly through shear frustration when key information is missing!) what constitute useful metadata in your field of work. \\n\\nMetadata can be included in the file itself (if the file format allows it), as separate files, or in the form of some other documents. When sourcing data, always make a note of where the data come from. This is especially true if getting data online as it is very easy to download data and then forget where they come from. Detailed note-taking is part of the job of the data analyst (and that of any scientist!). \\n\\nWhen metadata is included in the file directly, this typically comes as a header, or in a specified location in the file. The netCDF format has rules for how/where to include metadata, which is one of the reason why netCDF data are particularly useful and popular in climate science. \\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)\\n\\n---', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 9}}, {'id': 1753903424623019, 'score': 0.6932168, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb_cell_37_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"### Climate Data Operators (CDO)\\nThe Climate Data Operators ([CDO](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo)) software is a collection of >600 operators for standard processing of climate and forecast model data.

The answer will depend on any additional constraints that one applies on these weights and on any additional properties one wishes the field $F$ or $D$ to have (stationarity of various moments, isotropy, etc.). Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}]",

For any given query point $\\\\vec{x}_0$, the necessary correction is calcuated as a weighted sum of contributions from the available samples $x_i$. The big question is what values should the weight corresponding to each sample have? Answering this question is not easy - it is basically the whole point of kriging. The answer will depend on any additional constraints that one applies on these weights and on any additional properties one wishes the field $F$ or $D$ to have (stationarity of various moments, isotropy, etc.). Different assumptions/requirements results in different types of kriging: **simple kriging**, **ordinary kriging**, **universal kriging**, etc. In all cases, though, the weights $b(x_i)$ are obtained by using least-squares optimization and minimizing the error defined by the difference between the true field and the prediction.\\n\\nA full mathematical description is beyond the scope here, but we will just point out that implementation of krigging in practice usually requires the user to specify a `variogram`.\\n', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 23}}, {'id': 1753905536915787, 'score': 0.6078571, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_timeseriesanalysis.ipynb_cell_33_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"<a id='spectral'></a>\\n# Spectral analysis and frequency domain analysis\\n\\nSo far, all the methods discussed applied to the so-called 'time domain'. \\n\\nIt is possible, and often desireable, to transform the original detrended data (but still containing periodic signals) into the [`frequency domain`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_domain). \\n\\nTypical techniques for frequency domain analysis are the `Fourier transform` and `wavelet analysis`.

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \\n\\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \\n\\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \\n\", 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb', 'cell_number': 1}}, {'id': 1753903968046490, 'score': 0.6140957, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_22_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': '### Krigging (a.k.a objective mapping, a.k.a Gauss-Markov regression)\\n\\nKriging takes many names, depending on the field of study.

This latter statement could be translated as follows.\\n\\nJust as time-series were characterized by an autocorrelation function indicating that the values at time $t$ were not necessarily independent from previous values at times $t-\\\\tau$, points in space $(x_i,y_i)$ can also be thought of as correlated with any number of neighboring points $(x_k,y_k)$, $(x_l,y_l)$, etc. In time-series analysis and geostatistics, a Gauss-Markov regression model is a means of specifying the degree of correlation (i.e the memory) between neighboring points.

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \\n\\n\\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \\n\\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\\n\\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \\n\\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \\n\\n\\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \\n\\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported).

Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\\n\\nYou\\'ll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \\n\\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \\n\\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \\n\\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\\n\\n## This segment of the module\\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\\n\\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \\nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \\nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\\n\\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\\n\\n\\n## We will focus and use climate data.\\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \\n\\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \\n___', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 0}}, {'id': 1753902300119549, 'score': 0.6468454, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf_chunk_5', 'type': 'pdf', 'content': 'added)•flows forward, then flows backwards•Ideally,shouldreturntoinitialvalues•Deviations are indicative of numerical issues\\nTesting the numerical core…when we don’t have an exact solution to compare to\\nThis highlights the problem of numerical diffusionEach schemewillhaveitsownweaknesses andstrengths (and conservation properties)\\nWhat does a numericalmodel need?summary•Need equations (+ parameterizations)–Output = function(input)•Need a starting point–Boundary conditions•Must define time and spa', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\02v1_Building_climate_models_copy.pdf', 'chunk_number': 5}}, {'id': 1753903967981470, 'score': 0.64149565, 'payload': {'original_id': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_spatialanalysis.ipynb_cell_0_md', 'type': 'markdown', 'content': \"---\\n\\n# 03 Environmental Data: Thinking spatially\\n\\n---\\n\\n<a id='Contents'></a>\\n* ## Contents\\n- [Spatial data](#spatial)\\n- [Surface interpolation](#surface)\\n- [Gridded data](#gridded)\\n- [Scattered data](#scattered)\\n- [Surface fitting](#fitting)\\n- [Plotting and manipulating spatial data](#plotting)\\n- [Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)](#crs)\\n- [Geopandas](#geopandas)\\n- [Cartopy](#cartopy)\\n- [A nicer example](#example)\\n  \\n* ## Learning outcomes\\n1.

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \\n\\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe (\\'18\\' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \\n\\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that\\'s a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \\n\\nAlthough UKCP18 is \\'just\\' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\\n\\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\\n\\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn\\'t contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \\n\\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\\n\\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \\n\\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\\n\\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \\nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \\n\\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \\n\\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \\n\\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \\n\\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\\n3. Output: Data only\\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\\n   \\nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \\n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \\n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \\n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \\n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can\\'t differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \\n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that\\'s a lot of data!).\\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \\n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \\n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \\n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don\\'t close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \\n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \\n\\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\\n\\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \\n\\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we\\'ll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\\n\\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\\n\\n\\n[back to contents](#Contents)', 'source_document': 'uploads\\\\intro_to_climatedata.ipynb', 'cell_number': 46}}]",
