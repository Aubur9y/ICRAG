      "<a id='NetCDF'></a>\n\n## Network Common Data Form (NetCDF)\n\n[NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) is one of the most common data format used to store climate data. NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\n\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \n\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\n\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\n\n\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)). [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu) also manages [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu), one of the first center to have developped climate models and is today one of the gold-standard on the topic. \n\nNCAR also developed [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu), an interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization (we will not use NCL here, but the python package `ESMValTool` has build-in support for it). \n\n[NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu) has also developped the [climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu), a tool to search and access >200 data sets specific to the ocean, land and the atmosphere. (Some of these data may or may not also be found on CEDA.) \n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---",

      "## Useful tools to read, create or manipulate NetCDF files\n\nBecause they are so common, various tools have been developped to effectively  manipulate NetCDF files. We will here only discuss a few of them, notably the `netCDF4` python interface, and the `nco` routines which work on the command-line.\n\n---\n* ### Python support for NetCDF\n---\n\n`netCDF4`: As expected, Unidata provides an [API for its NetCDF C library](http://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/). This can be installed with `pip` or `conda`, via the conda-forge: `conda install -c conda-forge netCDF4`. \n  It can read/write files in any of the NetCDF formats (NETCDF3_CLASSIC, NETCDF3_64BIT_OFFSET, NETCDF3_64BIT_DATA, NETCDF4_CLASSIC, and NETCDF4). The latest NETCDF4 format create files readable by HDF5 clients as well.\n  \n  Detailed instructions on the use of `netCDF4` can be found [here](http://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/). We are here only going to demonstrate a few features. \n\nBefore looking at the internal structure of a file, let's create an empty NetCDF file using python into a new `output/` directory. To do this, we need to import the `Dataset` constructor from `netCDF4`. \n"

      "---\n\n# <center> Environmental Data </center>\n\n---\n\n## Course objectives and philosophy\nLet's start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\n\n1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\n\nYou'll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \n\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \n\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \n\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\n\n## This segment of the module\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\n\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\n\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\n\n\n## We will focus and use climate data.\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \n\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \n___",

      "<a id='fitting'></a>\n# Surface fitting\n\nThe interpolation techniques described above work very well when the space is relatively well-sampled, when one does not want to extrapolate beyond the convex hull and in the absence of variability or uncertainties associated the control points. If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\n\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \n\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement. The contoured estimate will tend to either over or underestimate the true value, within a tolerance controlled by the noise associated with the measurements. \n\nThe shape of the fitted surface will depend strongly on the data available: their locations, their uncertainties, as well as subjective choices made during the analysis (i.e. definition of the so-called 'covariance matrix').\n\nWe will here look at a technique called **kriging**, pioneered by a South African mining engineer called Danie G.

Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n"

Understand common data format and databasestructures specific to representative fields of environmental science2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories3. ",
      "<a id='NetCDF'></a>\n\n## Network Common Data Form (NetCDF)\n\n[NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) is one of the most common data format used to store climate data. NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\n\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \n\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\n\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\n\n\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)). [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu) also manages [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu), one of the first center to have developped climate models and is today one of the gold-standard on the topic. \n\nNCAR also developed [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu), an interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization (we will not use NCL here, but the python package `ESMValTool` has build-in support for it). \n\n[NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu) has also developped the [climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu), a tool to search and access >200 data sets specific to the ocean, land and the atmosphere. (Some of these data may or may not also be found on CEDA.) \n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---",
      "<a id='Metadata'></a>\n\n## The importance of Metadata\n[Metadata](https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/4428-metadata-basics) **relate to all the information necessary to interpret, understand and use a given dataset. Metadata are not the data themselves, but are required to provide context and therefore inform the data analysis.** \n\nThere are two types of metadata, \"**discover metadata**\", which can be used to locate the dataset in a search, and \"**detailed metadata**\", which contain the information necessary to use the data (ideally) without having to ask the data provider for more information (even if one of the key piece of information should be the data provider information and contact detail!).\n\nThere is no upper limit as to what information should be included in the metadata, but typical metadata comprise information about when and where the observations, or the file, where produced, how they were produced (which instrument, technique, algorithm were used), information about the experiment the data come from, maybe some information about data accuracy (if not provided as seperate data in the file), information about who produced the data or the file, including contact information, or appropriate reference(s), and, if relevant, additional information about the research context, i.e. which project is associated with these data (this could help the user understand if more data from this group/project exist or can be expected). If the data represent a subset of a larger dataset, this should also be mentioned. \n\nAnother key pieces of information that the metadata should provide are a description of the variables in the file, with variable **names**, and the **units** of these variables. \n\nIf the data in the file represent a processed version of other raw data, then one should add information about these raw data as well, their provenance, references, and the transformation that was made, etc. One should be able to track the chain of information all the way to the orginal observations (or model output). \n\nIf the data represent gridded variables, then the nature of the grid on which these data are defined should also be explained. \n\nSimilarly, if the position, or some other features of the data, depend on a reference system, that reference system should be given. This will be discussed in more depth during the introduction to geostatistics lecture. \n\nIn the case of climate models (or other models, if relevant), the metadata should also include information about the model itself, the model name, version, the length of the integration, maybe a brief description of the spin-up, boundary conditions, initial conditions used to produce the simulation. \n\nObviously the information that will be included in the metadata vary substantially. You should learn (and will discover - mostly through shear frustration when key information is missing!) what constitute useful metadata in your field of work. \n\nMetadata can be included in the file itself (if the file format allows it), as separate files, or in the form of some other documents. When sourcing data, always make a note of where the data come from. This is especially true if getting data online as it is very easy to download data and then forget where they come from. Detailed note-taking is part of the job of the data analyst (and that of any scientist!). \n\nWhen metadata is included in the file directly, this typically comes as a header, or in a specified location in the file. The netCDF format has rules for how/where to include metadata, which is one of the reason why netCDF data are particularly useful and popular in climate science. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---"

NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\n\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \n\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\n\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\n\n\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)). [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu) also manages [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu), one of the first center to have developped climate models and is today one of the gold-standard on the topic. \n\nNCAR also developed [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu), an interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization (we will not use NCL here, but the python package `ESMValTool` has build-in support for it). \n\n[NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu) has also developped the [climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu), a tool to search and access >200 data sets specific to the ocean, land and the atmosphere.

    "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know the relationship between discretization schemes like forward Euler, backward Euler, and centered difference, and their effects on accuracy and stability in climate models. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided contexts. Let me go through each one.\n\nContext 1 mentions numerical issues, deviations indicating problems, and that each scheme has weaknesses and strengths. It talks about numerical diffusion but doesn't specify the schemes. \n\nContext 2 discusses discretization, mentioning choices like Dx, Dy, Dz, Dt, stencil size, numerical stability, and computational costs. It also references Taylor series expansions. The mention of forward difference (Forward Euler) and backward difference (Backward Euler) here. Also, there's a note that climate models use more complex schemes. \n\nContext 3 has more details. It explains forward Euler as using Ci+1 = Ci(1 + λΔt), which is explicit. Backward Euler requires solving Ci+1 = Ci(1/(1 - λΔt)), which is implicit. It also mentions centered difference, though not explicitly named, but the context talks about discretization of derivatives and numerical integration. \n\nSo, the answer should connect these schemes to accuracy and stability. Forward Euler is explicit, which can be unstable for large time steps but simple. Backward Euler is implicit, more stable but requires solving equations. Centered difference might offer better accuracy but could introduce oscillations. The contexts mention numerical stability and computational costs, which are factors. \n\nI need to make sure each point is cited correctly. For example, when talking about Forward Euler, cite Context 3. Backward Euler is also in Context 3. The mention of stability and accuracy differences should be linked to the schemes. Also, note that climate models use more complex schemes, which might imply that these basic ones are part of the discussion. \n\nCheck if all info is from the contexts. The user's question is about the relationship between the schemes and their effects. The answer should list each scheme's impact on accuracy and stability, citing the relevant contexts. Make sure not to add anything not in the contexts. For example, if the contexts don't mention centered difference's stability, don't include it. Wait, Context 2 mentions \"centered difference\" in the list of schemes. Let me check again.\n\nIn Context 2, the user lists \"forward Euler, backward Euler, centered difference\" as examples. So the answer should include all three. However, the contexts might not detail all their effects. For example, Context 3 talks about Forward and Backward Euler, but maybe not centered difference. \n\nWait, Context 3 mentions \"discretization of derivatives and numerical integration to step forward from t_i to t_f = NΔt. Forward difference (aka Forward Euler) and Backward difference (aka backward Euler). So centered difference isn't discussed in detail here. But the user's question includes it as an example. \n\nThe answer needs to mention all three schemes. However, the contexts might not have enough info on all. For example, centered difference's stability and accuracy. If the contexts don't mention it, then maybe the answer can't include it. But the user's question includes it as an example, so the answer should address it if possible. \n\nLooking back, Context 2 mentions \"discretization\" and \"choices of Dx, Dy, Dz, Dt, size of the stencil, numerical stability, computational ability/costs,\" which might relate to centered difference. But the specific schemes' effects on accuracy and stability are only detailed for Forward and Backward Euler in Context 3. \n\nSo, the answer should mention Forward Euler (explicit, less stable, simple), Backward Euler (implicit, more stable, requires solving equations), and centered difference (maybe higher accuracy but possible oscillations). But since the contexts don't explicitly mention centered difference's stability, maybe the answer can only cover the first two. However, the user's question includes all three as examples, so the answer must address them. \n\nWait, the user's question says \"e.g., forward Euler, backward Euler, centered difference\" which means they are examples, not that all three are discussed. So the answer can focus on the ones discussed in the contexts. \n\nIn Context 3, Forward Euler is explicit, which can be unstable for large time steps (stability), but simple. Backward Euler is implicit, more stable but requires solving equations. The contexts don't mention centered difference's stability, but maybe the general idea is that centered difference has higher accuracy but can introduce oscillations (numerical diffusion). \n\nSo, the answer should list each scheme's impact on accuracy and stability based on the contexts. For example, Forward Euler's stability and accuracy, Backward Euler's stability, and centered difference's accuracy. But need to check if the contexts support that. \n\nIn Context 3, the Forward Euler is explicit, which is known for potential instability, and Backward Euler is implicit",

For illustration, we will create a set of data which are stationary, and another which is non-stationary (with a seasonal cycle).",
      "#### Variograms, correlograms and semi-variograms\n\nKrigging requires estimation of a so-called covariance matrix, which describes the relationship between observations. Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\n\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \n\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\n  \\begin{equation}\n    \\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\left(1-exp\\left(\\frac{-h}{ra}\\right)\\right)+n_{(0,\\infty)}\n  \\end{equation}\n    \n2. Gaussian semivariogram model\n  \\begin{equation}\n    \\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\left(1-exp\\left(\\frac{h^2}{a^2}\\right)\\right)+n_{(0,\\infty)}\n  \\end{equation}\n  \n3. Spherical semivariogram model\n  \\begin{equation}\n  \\gamma(h) =\n  \\begin{cases}\n    (s-n)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{h}{a}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{h}{a}\\right)^3 \\right)+n_{(0,\\infty)} & \\text{for }h\\le a,\\\\\n    (s-n) & \\text{for }h > a.\n  \\end{cases}\n  \\end{equation}\n\n\nIn the functions above, $h$ is distance. $s$ is called the `sill`, the value that $\\gamma(h)$ tends to as h goes to $\\infty$. $r$ is the `range`, or the distance at which the difference $\\gamma(h)-s$ becomes negligible. $n$ is called the `nugget` parameter. It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\n\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\n\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\n\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\n\n\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$. At this point, one can either compute the **spatial covariance**\n\n\\begin{equation}\nC(k \\Delta h)=\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k\\Delta h)d(x_i)\n\\end{equation}\n\nfrom which we can compute the **correlogram**, which is simply the spatial covariance normalized by the data variance (at $k=0$) so as to limit its range to $\\pm 1$,\n\n\\label{eq:corelogram}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\rho(k \\Delta  h)=\\frac{C(k \\Delta h)}{C(0)}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k \\Delta  h)d(x_i)}{\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^m(d(x_i)^2)}\n\\end{equation}\n\nor look at the mean squared difference and form the **semivariogram**\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\gamma(k \\Delta  h)=\\frac{1}{2m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^m\\left(d(x_i+k\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\right)^2.\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe functional forms $C(h)$, $\\rho(h)$ or $\\gamma(h)$ of these binned, discrete estimates is obtained simply by plotting $C(k\\Delta h)$, $\\rho(k\\Delta  h)$ or $\\gamma(k\\Delta  h)$ as a function of $k\\Delta h$ and by fitting a polynomial throught the results that ensures strictly positive values of $C(h)$, $\\rho(h)$ or $\\gamma(h)$ for any $h$.\n\nNote that the corelogram in geostatistics is very similar to the autocorrelation function used in time-series analysis. Indeed, as the lag-distance increases, both $\\rho(h)$ and $C(h)$ decrease, while $\\gamma(h)$ increases.\n\n---",
      "We see how the Zivot_Andrews results are much clearer in this case, with a p-values for the periodic case that is undeniably larger than 5% (we would make a big mistake by rejecting the null-hypothesis of non-stationarity!). This example shows how one needs to understand how parameteric tests behave and probably shouldn't 'just believe' them blindly. In this example, the critical aspect is of course the signal-to-noise in 'periodic_walk1'. The amplitude of the periodic signal is weak compared to the magnitude of the random noise, and this can make it harder for the tests to detect the non-stationarity. This shows also that there is not aways a clear line between weak-stationarity and non-stationarity. "

The signal can be additive, with trends, periods, and errors, e.g. $X_t=T_t+S_t+E_t$, or multiplicative, e.g. $X_t=T_t \\cdot S_t \\cdot E_t$, where the amplitude of variations of the data could be changing through time. \n\nThere are many types of models for time series data, each of which can take various forms and represent different stochastic processes. However, three broad classes are very common and of practical importance: \n1.  the autoregressive (AR) models, \n2.  the integrated (I) models, and \n3.  the moving average (MA) models. \n   \nThese three types of models all depend linearly on previous data points (other classes of models exist), and use that information to make a forecast into the future. One is generally interested in [developing these models to forecast](https://medium.com/wegaw/time-series-forecasting-in-python-from-zero-to-neural-networks-in-only-a-month-8e12d6a6e2f4), statistically, the (possibly future) behaviour of the data. Another useful application is to simulate the behaviour of observed random processes (e.g. to use as input to other models, or propagate errors).\n\nCombinations of ideas underlying the AR and MA models produce  **autoregressive moving average ([ARMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive–moving-average_model)) models**, while combination of all three types yields the **autoregressive integrated moving average ([ARIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average)) models** . The **autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average model ([ARFIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_fractionally_integrated_moving_average))**  generalizes all of this by allowing non-integer values of the 'differencing parameter'.\n\n",

      "<a id='spatial'></a>\n# Analysis of spatial data\n\nSo far in this class, we have mostly considered the analysis of data-series from single locations, where some property is measured repeadedly in time, or data that came already gridded in easy to use format. \n\nHowever, often in environmental sciences, we are faced with a different or additional problem; that is one will have to either make sense of many single measurements dispersed in space or even with multiple time-series dispersed in space. \n\nThe problem of making sense of spatially dispersed data is often linked to the problem of `contouring`. Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \n\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \n\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \n",

      "---\n\n# <center> Environmental Data </center>\n\n---\n\n## Course objectives and philosophy\nLet's start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\n\n1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\n\nYou'll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \n\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \n\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \n\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\n\n## This segment of the module\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\n\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\n\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\n\n\n## We will focus and use climate data.\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \n\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \n___"
