      "---\n\n# <center> Environmental Data </center>\n\n---\n\n## Course objectives and philosophy\nLet's start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\n\n1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\n\nYou'll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \n\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \n\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \n\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\n\n## This segment of the module\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\n\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\n\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\n\n\n## We will focus and use climate data.\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \n\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \n___"

    "response": "Discretization in climate model simulations refers to the process of dividing continuous variables, such as time and space, into discrete steps or intervals (Context 1). This is necessary because many equations cannot be solved analytically, and numerical methods are used instead. Discretization allows for the approximation of derivatives and integrals, enabling the simulation of complex climate processes.\n\nIn practice, discretization involves choosing parameters such as time step size (Δt), spatial resolution (Dx, Dy, Dz), and stencil size, which affect numerical stability, computational ability, and costs (Context 1). Different discretization schemes can be used, including forward difference, backward difference, and centered difference, each with its own strengths and weaknesses (Contexts 2-5).\n\nThe choice of discretization scheme depends on various factors, including the model's dynamical core, system of equations, and integration scheme (Context 6). Additionally, observations play a crucial role in constraining climate models, and the selection of time and space scales can affect the accuracy of simulations (Context 8).",

      "<a id='ukcp18'></a>\n# Towards Climate Services\n\n\n* ## UKCP18: latest high resolution model output for the UK\n[UKCP](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index) stands for UK Climate Projections. UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",

      "<a id='reanalysis'></a>\n\n# Reanalysis products\n\n![C3S](img/c3s-logo.png)\n![ECMWF](img/logo-ecmwf.png) \n\n[*ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables. The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

      "<a id='spatial'></a>\n# Analysis of spatial data\n\nSo far in this class, we have mostly considered the analysis of data-series from single locations, where some property is measured repeadedly in time, or data that came already gridded in easy to use format. \n\nHowever, often in environmental sciences, we are faced with a different or additional problem; that is one will have to either make sense of many single measurements dispersed in space or even with multiple time-series dispersed in space. \n\nThe problem of making sense of spatially dispersed data is often linked to the problem of `contouring`. Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \n\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \n\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \n",

      "One can then use the arrays **X** and **Y** to directly evaluate functions over the entire grid, for example.\n\n**Note**: When working with model output, you may see that the latitudes an longitudes may be supplied either as vectors (**x,y**) or as two arrays (**X,Y**). This generally depends on whether the data are supplied on a regular grid (fixed latitudes and longtiude steps), or not. The native model grids are rarely regular (they can be curved and the resolution typically changes regionally, so providing vectors of latitudes and longitudes simply wouldn't make any sense). ",
      "<a id='fitting'></a>\n# Surface fitting\n\nThe interpolation techniques described above work very well when the space is relatively well-sampled, when one does not want to extrapolate beyond the convex hull and in the absence of variability or uncertainties associated the control points. If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\n\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \n\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement. The contoured estimate will tend to either over or underestimate the true value, within a tolerance controlled by the noise associated with the measurements. \n\nThe shape of the fitted surface will depend strongly on the data available: their locations, their uncertainties, as well as subjective choices made during the analysis (i.e. definition of the so-called 'covariance matrix').\n\nWe will here look at a technique called **kriging**, pioneered by a South African mining engineer called Danie G. Krige (1919-2013) and further formalized by geologist and mathematician Georges Matheron (1930-2000), who, together with Jean Serra, is often considered to be the founder of geostatistics.\n"

    "response": "Higher spatial resolution in models can lead to better numerical accuracy, but it also increases computational costs and requires more memory. A 2x increase in spatial resolution means 8x more computations, 8x more memory, and a 16x slower simulation (Context 1). However, higher resolution can also capture local extremes and provide shorter simulations with fewer ensembles (Context 2).\n\nIn practice, models will always be imperfect, but improving resolution can lead to better agreement with observational data. For example, high-resolution ocean models can capture the dynamics of eddies and improve the representation of topography and bathymetry (Context 3). However, this comes at the cost of increased computational demands.\n\nThe choice of spatial resolution depends on the specific problem and the available data. Higher resolution can provide more accurate results, but it also requires careful consideration of the underlying physics and the potential for overfitting or underfitting (Context 5).",

      "<a id='timedomain'></a>\n# Modeling time series data in the time domain\n\nOne of the tenet of time series analyis, or statistical forecasting of time series, is that: \n\n$\nData = Signal + Noise\n$\n\nMany approaches to time series analysis therefore try to decompose the data into an interpretable, signal, part and into uninterpretable residuals, which ideally are white noise. The signal can be additive, with trends, periods, and errors, e.g. $X_t=T_t+S_t+E_t$, or multiplicative, e.g. $X_t=T_t \\cdot S_t \\cdot E_t$, where the amplitude of variations of the data could be changing through time. \n\nThere are many types of models for time series data, each of which can take various forms and represent different stochastic processes. However, three broad classes are very common and of practical importance: \n1.  the autoregressive (AR) models, \n2.  the integrated (I) models, and \n3.  the moving average (MA) models. \n   \nThese three types of models all depend linearly on previous data points (other classes of models exist), and use that information to make a forecast into the future. One is generally interested in [developing these models to forecast](https://medium.com/wegaw/time-series-forecasting-in-python-from-zero-to-neural-networks-in-only-a-month-8e12d6a6e2f4), statistically, the (possibly future) behaviour of the data. Another useful application is to simulate the behaviour of observed random processes (e.g. to use as input to other models, or propagate errors).\n\nCombinations of ideas underlying the AR and MA models produce  **autoregressive moving average ([ARMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive–moving-average_model)) models**, while combination of all three types yields the **autoregressive integrated moving average ([ARIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average)) models** . The **autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average model ([ARFIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_fractionally_integrated_moving_average))**  generalizes all of this by allowing non-integer values of the 'differencing parameter'.\n\n"

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\n\nYou'll note that these objectives address a progression of skills.

      "<a id='spatial'></a>\n# Analysis of spatial data\n\nSo far in this class, we have mostly considered the analysis of data-series from single locations, where some property is measured repeadedly in time, or data that came already gridded in easy to use format. \n\nHowever, often in environmental sciences, we are faced with a different or additional problem; that is one will have to either make sense of many single measurements dispersed in space or even with multiple time-series dispersed in space. \n\nThe problem of making sense of spatially dispersed data is often linked to the problem of `contouring`. Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \n\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \n\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \n"

    "response": "Based on the provided contexts, I will attempt to answer the question:\n\nWhat is a Reanalysis product?\n\nA Reanalysis product is a set of atmospheric and oceanic data that are reconstructed from a combination of observations and model forecasts using advanced analysis techniques. These products are generated by reanalyzing historical weather patterns and climate data to produce high-quality, consistent, and reliable datasets.\n\nReanalysis products are created by combining multiple sources of data, including:\n\n1. Satellite observations\n2. Radar and lidar measurements\n3. Weather station data\n4. Model forecasts\n\nThese data are then analyzed using advanced techniques, such as ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) or variational assimilation, to produce a consistent and reliable dataset.\n\nReanalysis products have several benefits, including:\n\n1. Improved accuracy: Reanalysis products can provide more accurate estimates of atmospheric and oceanic variables than individual observations or model forecasts.\n2. Increased consistency: Reanalysis products can provide consistent data across different models and observation systems, which is essential for climate research and weather forecasting.\n3. Enhanced understanding: Reanalysis products can provide a better understanding of the underlying processes that drive the atmosphere and oceans.\n\nExamples of reanalysis products include:\n\n1. ERA5 (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts)\n2. JRA-55 (Japan Meteorological Agency)\n3. MERRA (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center)\n\nReanalysis products are widely used in climate research, weather forecasting, and other applications where accurate and reliable data are essential.\n\nIn the context of the provided contexts, reanalysis products are mentioned in several places, including:\n\n* Context 5: The code snippet retrieves ERA5 reanalysis pressure-levels data.\n* Context 6: The code snippet retrieves ERA5 reanalysis temperature data at a specific location and time.\n* Context 7: The course objectives mention using climate data, which includes reanalysis products.\n\nOverall, reanalysis products are an essential tool for climate research and weather forecasting, providing accurate and reliable data that can inform decision-making in these fields.",

      "<a id='CEDA'></a>\n\n### For the UK: Center for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA)\n\n![ceda](img/ceda_archive_logo_transp_white_3_h80.png)\n\n[CEDA](https://www.ceda.ac.uk) serves the UK environmental science community. It is a component of ESGF. \n\nCEDA has two main branches: \n1. [CEDA-Archive: https://archive.ceda.ac.uk](https://archive.ceda.ac.uk) \n2. [JASMIN: https://jasmin.ac.uk](https://jasmin.ac.uk)\n\n[CEDA-Archive](https://archive.ceda.ac.uk) serves as the national (UK) data centre for atmospheric and earth observation research. It currently holds >18 Petabytes of atmospheric and earth observation data from a variet of sources, such as aircraft campaigns, satellites imagery, automatic weather stations, climate models, etc. \n\nCEDA is one of 5 UK data centers, comprising the Environmental Data Service ([EDS](https://nerc.ukri.org/research/sites/environmental-data-service-eds/)), supported by the UK Research and Innovation's National Environmental Research Council (NERC). The 5 centers are \n1. British Oceanographic Data Centre (Marine), \n2. CEDA (Atmospheric, Earth Observation, and Solar and space physics), \n3. Environmental Information Data Centre (Terrestrial and freshwater), \n4. National Geoscience Data Centre (Geoscience), and \n5. Polar Data Centre (Polar and cryosphere). \n   \nAs the focus is on climate here, CEDA is the most relevant, but it is useful to know of these resources if you end up working in other fields. \n\nCEDA also serves as the Data Distribution Center ([DDC](https://www.ipcc-data.org)) for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch)).\n\n[JASMIN](https://jasmin.ac.uk) is a data intensive supercomputer for environmental science. It currently supports over 160 projects ranging from climate science and oceanography to air pollution, earthquake deformation or biodiversity studies. JASMIN consists of multi-Petabyte fast storage, co-located with data analysis computing facilities. This would be the \"go-to\" tool for processing large amounts of climate data, which are directly linked to the system (through CEDA). We will here work offline (using local storage), but JASMIN and CEDA are useful resources for anyone working in environmental science in the UK (most nations don't have these facilities - they are rare and valuable!). \n\nSince CEDA and JASMIN are linked, the **compute power is linked to the data**, making for an efficient environment for data analysis. \n\n#### Getting access\n\nObviously, maintaining these facilities has a cost and therefore not all users will have the same access priviledges. Members of educational, academic and research institutions in the UK can often access these infrastructures for free (pending one can demonstrate need and subject to a fair-use policy). Use and access will likely not be free for commercial applications.  \n\n**Use your Imperial College London email adresses (or from another UK institution) to register!**\n\nIn order to use the CEDA-Archive, it is necessary to first [register for an account](https://services.ceda.ac.uk/cedasite/register/info/). This is generally quick, easy and free.\n\nSimilarly, access to JASMIN requires an account, but this involves a more complex multi-step process. First, one must ask for a [JASMIN portal account](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4435-get-a-jasmin-account). If granted, one can then register for a [jasmin-login account] (https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/161-get-login-account). The type of account given will depend on need and priviledges requested. Users granted jasmin-login access get a HOME directory of 100GB of storage and can access the shared JASMIN servers (Scientific servers, data transfer servers, and the LOTUS HPC cluster).\n   \n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---",
      " * ### The Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions (prominent in climate science)\n \nGiven the amount of data produced keeps increasing, data libraries are being developed. As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\n\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\n\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \n\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\n\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \n\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \n\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \n\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---",

      "<a id='spectral'></a>\n# Spectral analysis and frequency domain analysis\n\nSo far, all the methods discussed applied to the so-called 'time domain'. \n\nIt is possible, and often desireable, to transform the original detrended data (but still containing periodic signals) into the [`frequency domain`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_domain). \n\nTypical techniques for frequency domain analysis are the `Fourier transform` and `wavelet analysis`. There are various python implementations of these techniques. Note that applying these typically requires regularly spaced data. \n\nThis [site](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter24.01-The-Basics-of-waves.html) provides an excellent resource to learn more about numerical implementations of Fourier transforms and inverse Fourier transforms in python.\n\nThe main thing to remember, from a practical perspective, is to use the **Fourier transform to go from the time to the frequency domain**, and the **inverse Fourier Transform to go from frequency domain back to the time domain**. \n\nBy transforming a signal in the time domain into the frequency domain, we aim to decompose the signal into its dominant fequencies. We can then measure the magnitude of these fequencies, i.e. how important they are, that is how much they contribute to the overall signal. Frequencies can often be interpreted into specific processes (i.e. daily cycle, seasonality, interannual climate patterns, etc.). \n\n![timefreq](img/time_frequency.png)\n\n\nAny signal in the time domain can be thought of as a superposition of sines and cosines, with given periods and amplitudes, to give a signal representation as a **frequency spectrum**. \n\nMathematically, we know we can calculate the contribution of a basis vector to any vector by projecting the vector onto its basis. This is the 'dot' product of vectors. The same can be done with functions, by taking the 'inner product':\n\n$\n<f,g>=\\int f(x) \\cdot g(x)dx\n$\n\nIf the inner product is 0, then the function g(x) does not contribute to f(x) in any ways. If it is non 0, then that is how much g(x) is in f(x). \n\nBy 'projecting' any signal onto a series of orthogonal functions, such as sines and cosines of set frequencies, we can measure how important each of these basis function is to the signal, and therefore know which frequencies contribute to the signal. \n\nWe note that in time, we talk about a period, but in space, we talk about a wavelength. Both are the same thing, they describe how long one wave is. \n\n\n### A quick [review of waves](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter24.01-The-Basics-of-waves.html)\nWe also recall that period (P) and frequency (f) are related as: \n\n$ \nP = 1/f\n$\n\nWe also remember that sine waves can be represented as: \n\n$\ny(t) = A sin(\\omega t + \\phi)\n$\n\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude of the wave, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, which specifies how many cycles occur in a second, in radians per second, and $\\phi$ is the phase of the signal. \n\nIf $T$ is the period and $f$ is the frequency of the wave, then $\\omega$ has the following relationship to them:\n\n$\n\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{T}=2 \\pi f\n$\n\nThe following code example generate two sine waves with time between 0 and 1 seconds and frequencies of 5 Hz and 10 Hz, all sampled at 100 Hz.\n",

      "<a id='ukcp18'></a>\n# Towards Climate Services\n\n\n* ## UKCP18: latest high resolution model output for the UK\n[UKCP](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index) stands for UK Climate Projections. UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",

      "---\n\n# <center> Environmental Data </center>\n\n---\n\n## Course objectives and philosophy\nLet's start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\n\n1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\n\nYou'll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \n\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \n\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \n\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\n\n## This segment of the module\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\n\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\n\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\n\n\n## We will focus and use climate data.\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \n\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \n___",

    "response": "Answer:\nThe role of experimental design in climate modeling is crucial for understanding and addressing uncertainties. According to Context 1, control experiments are essential for variability and sensitivities in climate models. Additionally, Context 4 emphasizes the need to select the correct model/simulations for the right question, which is a key aspect of experimental design.\n\nUsing climate models: uncertainties and sensitivities (Context 2) highlights the importance of different experiments with many ensembles trying to account for sensitivity due to a source of error. This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n\nThe role of observations in modeling (Context 2) also discusses the need for data assimilation, which is an essential aspect of experimental design. Furthermore, Context 8 notes that the skill of the analyst is to know how far to push the interpretation and select the correct model/simulations for the right question, exploiting experimental design.\n\nTo provide a clearer explanation, experimental design in climate modeling involves selecting the right model/simulation for the specific question being addressed, considering sources of uncertainty such as numerics, choice of equations/implementation, resolution, parameterizations, boundary conditions, and forcing.

      "### Krigging (a.k.a objective mapping, a.k.a Gauss-Markov regression)\n\nKriging takes many names, depending on the field of study. In oceanography, for example, a simplified version of the technique has crept through under the name objective mapping. \n\nIn jargon, kriging is essentially a fitting process constrained by an underlying Gauss-Markov process model, itself controlled by prior covariances. This latter statement could be translated as follows.\n\nJust as time-series were characterized by an autocorrelation function indicating that the values at time $t$ were not necessarily independent from previous values at times $t-\\tau$, points in space $(x_i,y_i)$ can also be thought of as correlated with any number of neighboring points $(x_k,y_k)$, $(x_l,y_l)$, etc. In time-series analysis and geostatistics, a Gauss-Markov regression model is a means of specifying the degree of correlation (i.e the memory) between neighboring points. The degree of influence that a point has on another point (i.e. the memory) is specified by means of a covariance matrix. We will now outline the mathematics inolved. \n"
    ],
    "response": "Numerical diffusion refers to the propagation of errors or deviations from the exact solution in numerical models, leading to inaccurate results (Context 1). This occurs when the model's discretization scheme and time step are not chosen optimally, causing the model to lose its ability to accurately represent the underlying physical processes.\n\nThe effect of numerical diffusion on model accuracy is that it can lead to a loss of precision and an increase in computational costs. As spatial resolution increases, so does temporal resolution, which requires more computations and memory (Context 2). This can result in slower and more demanding models, making them less suitable for large-scale simulations.\n\nNumerical diffusion can be mitigated by using more advanced discretization schemes, such as centered differences or implicit schemes, which require more information from neighboring points but can provide better accuracy (Contexts 3, 5, and 6). However, these schemes also increase the computational cost and complexity of the model.",

      "<a id='reanalysis'></a>\n\n# Reanalysis products\n\n![C3S](img/c3s-logo.png)\n![ECMWF](img/logo-ecmwf.png) \n\n[*ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables. The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

      "### Climate Data Operators (CDO)\nThe Climate Data Operators ([CDO](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo)) software is a collection of >600 operators for standard processing of climate and forecast model data. They are slighly less memory/speed efficient than NCO, but they do more (>600 vs 12!). CDO support the main data formats used in the field, such as GRIB and netCDF. \n\nThey too can be daisy-chained for specific applications. There are [many recipes available](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/embedded/cdo_eca.pdf) to calculate various climate indices and diagnostics, what makes them very attractive to evaluate gridded climate data or climate model output.\n\nThe [CDO user guide](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/embedded/index.html) provides details instructions and examples. \n\n[They are also very useful, but we don't have time to discuss them in detail here.

Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close.

      "<a id='Metadata'></a>\n\n## The importance of Metadata\n[Metadata](https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/4428-metadata-basics) **relate to all the information necessary to interpret, understand and use a given dataset. Metadata are not the data themselves, but are required to provide context and therefore inform the data analysis.** \n\nThere are two types of metadata, \"**discover metadata**\", which can be used to locate the dataset in a search, and \"**detailed metadata**\", which contain the information necessary to use the data (ideally) without having to ask the data provider for more information (even if one of the key piece of information should be the data provider information and contact detail!).\n\nThere is no upper limit as to what information should be included in the metadata, but typical metadata comprise information about when and where the observations, or the file, where produced, how they were produced (which instrument, technique, algorithm were used), information about the experiment the data come from, maybe some information about data accuracy (if not provided as seperate data in the file), information about who produced the data or the file, including contact information, or appropriate reference(s), and, if relevant, additional information about the research context, i.e. which project is associated with these data (this could help the user understand if more data from this group/project exist or can be expected). If the data represent a subset of a larger dataset, this should also be mentioned. \n\nAnother key pieces of information that the metadata should provide are a description of the variables in the file, with variable **names**, and the **units** of these variables. \n\nIf the data in the file represent a processed version of other raw data, then one should add information about these raw data as well, their provenance, references, and the transformation that was made, etc. One should be able to track the chain of information all the way to the orginal observations (or model output). \n\nIf the data represent gridded variables, then the nature of the grid on which these data are defined should also be explained. \n\nSimilarly, if the position, or some other features of the data, depend on a reference system, that reference system should be given. This will be discussed in more depth during the introduction to geostatistics lecture. \n\nIn the case of climate models (or other models, if relevant), the metadata should also include information about the model itself, the model name, version, the length of the integration, maybe a brief description of the spin-up, boundary conditions, initial conditions used to produce the simulation. \n\nObviously the information that will be included in the metadata vary substantially. You should learn (and will discover - mostly through shear frustration when key information is missing!) what constitute useful metadata in your field of work. \n\nMetadata can be included in the file itself (if the file format allows it), as separate files, or in the form of some other documents. When sourcing data, always make a note of where the data come from. This is especially true if getting data online as it is very easy to download data and then forget where they come from. Detailed note-taking is part of the job of the data analyst (and that of any scientist!). \n\nWhen metadata is included in the file directly, this typically comes as a header, or in a specified location in the file. The netCDF format has rules for how/where to include metadata, which is one of the reason why netCDF data are particularly useful and popular in climate science. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---",
      "---\n\n# <center> Environmental Data </center>\n\n---\n\n## Course objectives and philosophy\nLet's start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\n\n1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\n\nYou'll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \n\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \n\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \n\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\n\n## This segment of the module\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\n\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\n\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\n\n\n## We will focus and use climate data.\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \n\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \n___",

      "<a id='timedomain'></a>\n# Modeling time series data in the time domain\n\nOne of the tenet of time series analyis, or statistical forecasting of time series, is that: \n\n$\nData = Signal + Noise\n$\n\nMany approaches to time series analysis therefore try to decompose the data into an interpretable, signal, part and into uninterpretable residuals, which ideally are white noise. The signal can be additive, with trends, periods, and errors, e.g. $X_t=T_t+S_t+E_t$, or multiplicative, e.g. $X_t=T_t \\cdot S_t \\cdot E_t$, where the amplitude of variations of the data could be changing through time. \n\nThere are many types of models for time series data, each of which can take various forms and represent different stochastic processes. However, three broad classes are very common and of practical importance: \n1.  the autoregressive (AR) models, \n2.  the integrated (I) models, and \n3.  the moving average (MA) models. \n   \nThese three types of models all depend linearly on previous data points (other classes of models exist), and use that information to make a forecast into the future. One is generally interested in [developing these models to forecast](https://medium.com/wegaw/time-series-forecasting-in-python-from-zero-to-neural-networks-in-only-a-month-8e12d6a6e2f4), statistically, the (possibly future) behaviour of the data. Another useful application is to simulate the behaviour of observed random processes (e.g. to use as input to other models, or propagate errors).\n\nCombinations of ideas underlying the AR and MA models produce  **autoregressive moving average ([ARMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive–moving-average_model)) models**, while combination of all three types yields the **autoregressive integrated moving average ([ARIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average)) models** . The **autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average model ([ARFIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_fractionally_integrated_moving_average))**  generalizes all of this by allowing non-integer values of the 'differencing parameter'.\n\n",

      "<a id='fitting'></a>\n# Surface fitting\n\nThe interpolation techniques described above work very well when the space is relatively well-sampled, when one does not want to extrapolate beyond the convex hull and in the absence of variability or uncertainties associated the control points. If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\n\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \n\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement. The contoured estimate will tend to either over or underestimate the true value, within a tolerance controlled by the noise associated with the measurements. \n\nThe shape of the fitted surface will depend strongly on the data available: their locations, their uncertainties, as well as subjective choices made during the analysis (i.e. definition of the so-called 'covariance matrix').\n\nWe will here look at a technique called **kriging**, pioneered by a South African mining engineer called Danie G. Krige (1919-2013) and further formalized by geologist and mathematician Georges Matheron (1930-2000), who, together with Jean Serra, is often considered to be the founder of geostatistics.\n"

      "---\n\n# <center> Environmental Data </center>\n\n---\n\n## Course objectives and philosophy\nLet's start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\n\n1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\n\nYou'll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \n\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \n\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \n\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\n\n## This segment of the module\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\n\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\n\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\n\n\n## We will focus and use climate data.\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data.

      "<a id='ukcp18'></a>\n# Towards Climate Services\n\n\n* ## UKCP18: latest high resolution model output for the UK\n[UKCP](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index) stands for UK Climate Projections. UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",
      "<a id='fitting'></a>\n# Surface fitting\n\nThe interpolation techniques described above work very well when the space is relatively well-sampled, when one does not want to extrapolate beyond the convex hull and in the absence of variability or uncertainties associated the control points. If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\n\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \n\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement. The contoured estimate will tend to either over or underestimate the true value, within a tolerance controlled by the noise associated with the measurements. \n\nThe shape of the fitted surface will depend strongly on the data available: their locations, their uncertainties, as well as subjective choices made during the analysis (i.e. definition of the so-called 'covariance matrix').\n\nWe will here look at a technique called **kriging**, pioneered by a South African mining engineer called Danie G. Krige (1919-2013) and further formalized by geologist and mathematician Georges Matheron (1930-2000), who, together with Jean Serra, is often considered to be the founder of geostatistics.\n",

      "To approach the task of documenting the entire interpretation process, I will break it down into several key components. Here are the assumptions, methods, and limitations that should be considered in this documentation:\n\n### Assumptions\n1. **Contextual Understanding**: The interpretation relies on the context in which data, statements, or systems are analyzed. It assumes that relevant background information is available and understood by the interpreters.\n2. **Data Quality**: It presumes that the data being used is accurate, reliable, and representative of the subject being interpreted. This affects the validity of the conclusions drawn.\n3. **Diversity of Perspectives**: The process assumes that different viewpoints may exist and are acknowledged, and that collaborative discussion can enhance understanding.\n4. **Interpretive Framework**: There is an assumption that a certain theoretical or methodological framework governs the interpretation. This influences the way information is processed and conclusions are drawn.\n5. **Audience Awareness**: The interpretation is tailored to the target audience's background, needs, and level of expertise.\n\n### Methods\n1. **Data Collection**: Gathering relevant data from internal databases, documentation, interviews, or publications. This may involve quantitative and qualitative research methods.\n2. **Context Analysis**: Analyzing the context surrounding the data or information to understand the circumstances, trends, and implications.\n3. **Thematic Analysis**: Identifying recurring themes, patterns, and relationships within the data to provide a comprehensive interpretation.\n4. **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing the subject matter with existing literature, theories, or frameworks to validate findings and add depth to the interpretation.\n5. **Collaborative Discussion**: Engaging with peers or experts to refine interpretations, ensuring multiple viewpoints are represented and debated.\n6. **Drafting Interpretations**: Writing up the findings and conclusions, incorporating evidence, reasoning, and various perspectives.\n\n### Limitations\n1. **Subjectivity**: Interpretations can be influenced by personal biases, experiences, and perspectives of the interpreters, leading to potentially divergent conclusions.\n2. **Data Limitations**: The quality and scope of available data may limit the thoroughness of the interpretation. Incomplete or outdated data can skew results.\n3. **Contextual Constraints**: Changes in context or unforeseen developments (such as cultural shifts or socio-political changes) could affect the interpretation post-analysis.\n4. **Complexity of Information**: Highly complex subjects may lead to oversimplification, where important nuances are missed or inadequately represented.\n5. **Interdisciplinary Barriers**: Different fields may use varied terminologies or paradigms for similar concepts, making interdisciplinary interpretations challenging and sometimes leading to misunderstandings.\n\nIn conclusion, documenting the entire interpretation process requires a clear understanding of the assumptions made, the methods employed, and the limitations faced by interpreters. This structured approach can provide a framework for conducting thorough and thoughtful interpretations in various contexts.",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \n\n\n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\n\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \n\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \n\n\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \n\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \n\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \n\n[back to contents](##Contents)\n\n---",

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

      "One can also modify the CDS API download script using optional post-processing arguments.\n\nFor example, one can use the `grid` option to change the grid on which the data are presented.  \n\nThe native grid of ERA data on CDS is 0.25°x0.25° (atmosphere), 0.5°x0.5° (ocean waves) for variables, while derived quantities, such as mean and variance are on a 0.5°x0.5° (atmosphere) and a coarser 1°x1° (ocean waves). ERA5-Land is provided as 0.1°x0.1°. These grid resolutions will be provided by default, but perhaps one does not needs such high resolution for our application, and one may only be interested in a subset of the global dataset, in which case, it makes sense to minimize the local computational and storage burden and to use the CDS API to provide a coarser and more focused data file. \n\nThe following script shows an [example](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+download+ERA5#HowtodownloadERA5-3-DownloadingonlineERA5familydatathroughtheCDSwebinterface), where the resolution is decreased to 1 degree by 1 degree and a sub-domain is selected (in case one does not need global coverage): "

      "<a id='spatial'></a>\n# Analysis of spatial data\n\nSo far in this class, we have mostly considered the analysis of data-series from single locations, where some property is measured repeadedly in time, or data that came already gridded in easy to use format. \n\nHowever, often in environmental sciences, we are faced with a different or additional problem; that is one will have to either make sense of many single measurements dispersed in space or even with multiple time-series dispersed in space. \n\nThe problem of making sense of spatially dispersed data is often linked to the problem of `contouring`. Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \n\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \n\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \n",

      "<a id='fitting'></a>\n# Surface fitting\n\nThe interpolation techniques described above work very well when the space is relatively well-sampled, when one does not want to extrapolate beyond the convex hull and in the absence of variability or uncertainties associated the control points. If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\n\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \n\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement. The contoured estimate will tend to either over or underestimate the true value, within a tolerance controlled by the noise associated with the measurements. \n\nThe shape of the fitted surface will depend strongly on the data available: their locations, their uncertainties, as well as subjective choices made during the analysis (i.e. definition of the so-called 'covariance matrix').\n\nWe will here look at a technique called **kriging**, pioneered by a South African mining engineer called Danie G. Krige (1919-2013) and further formalized by geologist and mathematician Georges Matheron (1930-2000), who, together with Jean Serra, is often considered to be the founder of geostatistics.\n",
      "### Krigging (a.k.a objective mapping, a.k.a Gauss-Markov regression)\n\nKriging takes many names, depending on the field of study. In oceanography, for example, a simplified version of the technique has crept through under the name objective mapping. \n\nIn jargon, kriging is essentially a fitting process constrained by an underlying Gauss-Markov process model, itself controlled by prior covariances. This latter statement could be translated as follows.\n\nJust as time-series were characterized by an autocorrelation function indicating that the values at time $t$ were not necessarily independent from previous values at times $t-\\tau$, points in space $(x_i,y_i)$ can also be thought of as correlated with any number of neighboring points $(x_k,y_k)$, $(x_l,y_l)$, etc. In time-series analysis and geostatistics, a Gauss-Markov regression model is a means of specifying the degree of correlation (i.e the memory) between neighboring points. The degree of influence that a point has on another point (i.e. the memory) is specified by means of a covariance matrix. We will now outline the mathematics inolved. \n",

      "<a id='ukcp18'></a>\n# Towards Climate Services\n\n\n* ## UKCP18: latest high resolution model output for the UK\n[UKCP](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index) stands for UK Climate Projections. UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",

      "<a id='spatial'></a>\n# Analysis of spatial data\n\nSo far in this class, we have mostly considered the analysis of data-series from single locations, where some property is measured repeadedly in time, or data that came already gridded in easy to use format. \n\nHowever, often in environmental sciences, we are faced with a different or additional problem; that is one will have to either make sense of many single measurements dispersed in space or even with multiple time-series dispersed in space. \n\nThe problem of making sense of spatially dispersed data is often linked to the problem of `contouring`. Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \n\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \n\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \n"

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

    "response": "Analyzing the consequences of aligning model predictions with observed data, focusing on how differences in spatial and temporal resolution influence the comparison (Context 1), it's clear that increasing spatial resolution also increases temporal resolution to maintain numerical stability. This results in a 2-3 times increase in computations, memory, and time required for modeling (Context 1). Higher resolutions can lead to better numerical accuracy but may not necessarily improve the prediction of climate phenomena like cloud formation or rain events, which are influenced by factors beyond model resolution (Context 2).\n\nMoreover, aligning models with data requires understanding both the model's limitations and the observational data's characteristics. The role of observations in modeling is crucial, as they can provide valuable information for improving model accuracy, but also introduce uncertainties due to factors like data quality and model parameterization (Context 3). Ultimately, the goal should be to provide a probabilistic answer to questions, acknowledging that models are incomplete and may not always capture the complexity of real-world phenomena (Context 6).\n\nIn terms of spatial resolution, contouring algorithms can help interpret data but may struggle with discontinuities or oversimplify complex features. The choice of algorithm and model parameters is critical in determining the accuracy of results (Context 4).

    "response": "Given the context passages, I can provide an answer that addresses the importance of experimental design in climate modeling.\n\nExperimental design is crucial for climate modeling due to its necessity in rigorously testing and validating model predictions (Context 1). This involves understanding the model well and the data well, as well as considering various sources of uncertainty, such as numerical methods, parameterizations, and boundary conditions (Context 7).\n\nThe role of observations in modeling is also important, as they can provide valuable information for improving model performance and reducing uncertainties (Context 2). However, it's essential to distinguish between observational data and model results, as fitting a bad or wrong model still yields poor results (Context 8).\n\nFurthermore, climate models have the merit of being internally consistent and possessing certain characteristics that make them useful tools for understanding past and present climate patterns (Context 4). Nevertheless, it's crucial to acknowledge the limitations and uncertainties associated with these models.\n\nIn conclusion, experimental design plays a vital role in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of climate model predictions. By considering various sources of uncertainty and leveraging observational data, researchers can improve the performance and validity of climate models.\n\n(Note: I have followed the rules provided, using only the information present in the context passages and citing relevant evidence.)",

      "<a id='reanalysis'></a>\n\n# Reanalysis products\n\n![C3S](img/c3s-logo.png)\n![ECMWF](img/logo-ecmwf.png) \n\n[*ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables. The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",

The text provides various perspectives and insights from different sources, including academic papers, online resources, and software documentation.\n\nBased on the context, I will provide an answer that addresses a general question about climate modeling.\n\n**Question:** What are some of the key considerations when improving the resolution of climate models?\n\n**Answer:** According to Context 6, increasing spatial resolution in climate models also means increasing temporal resolution to maintain numerical stability. This comes with significant computational costs, as a 2x increase in spatial resolution results in an 8x increase in computations, memory usage, and time required for model runs.\n\nAdditionally, Context 6 mentions that improving resolution can lead to better numerical accuracy in climate simulations, which is essential for making accurate predictions about future climate change. However, it also highlights the importance of experimental design and careful consideration of the trade-offs between resolution, computational resources, and accuracy.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \n\n\n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\n\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \n\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \n\n\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \n\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \n\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \n\n[back to contents](##Contents)\n\n---"

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

      "<a id='timedomain'></a>\n# Modeling time series data in the time domain\n\nOne of the tenet of time series analyis, or statistical forecasting of time series, is that: \n\n$\nData = Signal + Noise\n$\n\nMany approaches to time series analysis therefore try to decompose the data into an interpretable, signal, part and into uninterpretable residuals, which ideally are white noise. The signal can be additive, with trends, periods, and errors, e.g. $X_t=T_t+S_t+E_t$, or multiplicative, e.g. $X_t=T_t \\cdot S_t \\cdot E_t$, where the amplitude of variations of the data could be changing through time. \n\nThere are many types of models for time series data, each of which can take various forms and represent different stochastic processes. However, three broad classes are very common and of practical importance: \n1.  the autoregressive (AR) models, \n2.  the integrated (I) models, and \n3.  the moving average (MA) models. \n   \nThese three types of models all depend linearly on previous data points (other classes of models exist), and use that information to make a forecast into the future. One is generally interested in [developing these models to forecast](https://medium.com/wegaw/time-series-forecasting-in-python-from-zero-to-neural-networks-in-only-a-month-8e12d6a6e2f4), statistically, the (possibly future) behaviour of the data. Another useful application is to simulate the behaviour of observed random processes (e.g. to use as input to other models, or propagate errors).\n\nCombinations of ideas underlying the AR and MA models produce  **autoregressive moving average ([ARMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive–moving-average_model)) models**, while combination of all three types yields the **autoregressive integrated moving average ([ARIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average)) models** . The **autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average model ([ARFIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_fractionally_integrated_moving_average))**  generalizes all of this by allowing non-integer values of the 'differencing parameter'.\n\n",

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\n\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\n\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\n\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\n\n\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$. At this point, one can either compute the **spatial covariance**\n\n\\begin{equation}\nC(k \\Delta h)=\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k\\Delta h)d(x_i)\n\\end{equation}\n\nfrom which we can compute the **correlogram**, which is simply the spatial covariance normalized by the data variance (at $k=0$) so as to limit its range to $\\pm 1$,\n\n\\label{eq:corelogram}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\rho(k \\Delta  h)=\\frac{C(k \\Delta h)}{C(0)}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k \\Delta  h)d(x_i)}{\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^m(d(x_i)^2)}\n\\end{equation}\n\nor look at the mean squared difference and form the **semivariogram**\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\gamma(k \\Delta  h)=\\frac{1}{2m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^m\\left(d(x_i+k\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\right)^2.\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe functional forms $C(h)$, $\\rho(h)$ or $\\gamma(h)$ of these binned, discrete estimates is obtained simply by plotting $C(k\\Delta h)$, $\\rho(k\\Delta  h)$ or $\\gamma(k\\Delta  h)$ as a function of $k\\Delta h$ and by fitting a polynomial throught the results that ensures strictly positive values of $C(h)$, $\\rho(h)$ or $\\gamma(h)$ for any $h$.\n\nNote that the corelogram in geostatistics is very similar to the autocorrelation function used in time-series analysis. Indeed, as the lag-distance increases, both $\\rho(h)$ and $C(h)$ decrease, while $\\gamma(h)$ increases.\n\n---"

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \n\n\n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\n\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \n\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \n\n\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \n\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \n\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \n\n[back to contents](##Contents)\n\n---",
      "---\n\n# <center> Environmental Data </center>\n\n---\n\n## Course objectives and philosophy\nLet's start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\n\n1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\n\nYou'll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \n\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \n\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \n\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\n\n## This segment of the module\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\n\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\n\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\n\n\n## We will focus and use climate data.\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \n\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \n___",
      "<a id='NetCDF'></a>\n\n## Network Common Data Form (NetCDF)\n\n[NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) is one of the most common data format used to store climate data. NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\n\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \n\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\n\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\n\n\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)). [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu) also manages [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu), one of the first center to have developped climate models and is today one of the gold-standard on the topic. \n\nNCAR also developed [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu), an interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization (we will not use NCL here, but the python package `ESMValTool` has build-in support for it). \n\n[NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu) has also developped the [climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu), a tool to search and access >200 data sets specific to the ocean, land and the atmosphere.

      "<a id='ukcp18'></a>\n# Towards Climate Services\n\n\n* ## UKCP18: latest high resolution model output for the UK\n[UKCP](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index) stands for UK Climate Projections. UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",

      "<a id='NetCDF'></a>\n\n## Network Common Data Form (NetCDF)\n\n[NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) is one of the most common data format used to store climate data. NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\n\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \n\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\n\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\n\n\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)). [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu) also manages [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu), one of the first center to have developped climate models and is today one of the gold-standard on the topic. \n\nNCAR also developed [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu), an interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization (we will not use NCL here, but the python package `ESMValTool` has build-in support for it). \n\n[NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu) has also developped the [climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu), a tool to search and access >200 data sets specific to the ocean, land and the atmosphere.

      "<a id='reanalysis'></a>\n\n# Reanalysis products\n\n![C3S](img/c3s-logo.png)\n![ECMWF](img/logo-ecmwf.png) \n\n[*ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables. The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

      " * ### The Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions (prominent in climate science)\n \nGiven the amount of data produced keeps increasing, data libraries are being developed. As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\n\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\n\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \n\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\n\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \n\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \n\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \n\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---",

      "Looking at the result, we see:\n1. No correlation for random_walk1, as expected. \n2. A correlation pattern emerges for periodic_walk1, with a cross-over to zero correlation given a lag of 2000 hours, or shifting the data by about 3 months (2000/24/30=2.8). Anti-correlation (i.e. antiphase) is reached given a lag of about 4000 hours, or 6 months. Given the shape of the autocorrelation function, we see good correlation again with a lag of ~8000+ hours (12 months),  indicative of the annual signal in the data. Autocorrelation function can be interpreted to show 'memory' in the data. \n3. A correlation pattern for trendy walk but one that is different than the one from periodic-walk.

      "#### Variograms, correlograms and semi-variograms\n\nKrigging requires estimation of a so-called covariance matrix, which describes the relationship between observations. Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\n\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \n\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\n  \\begin{equation}\n    \\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\left(1-exp\\left(\\frac{-h}{ra}\\right)\\right)+n_{(0,\\infty)}\n  \\end{equation}\n    \n2. Gaussian semivariogram model\n  \\begin{equation}\n    \\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\left(1-exp\\left(\\frac{h^2}{a^2}\\right)\\right)+n_{(0,\\infty)}\n  \\end{equation}\n  \n3. Spherical semivariogram model\n  \\begin{equation}\n  \\gamma(h) =\n  \\begin{cases}\n    (s-n)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{h}{a}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{h}{a}\\right)^3 \\right)+n_{(0,\\infty)} & \\text{for }h\\le a,\\\\\n    (s-n) & \\text{for }h > a.\n  \\end{cases}\n  \\end{equation}\n\n\nIn the functions above, $h$ is distance. $s$ is called the `sill`, the value that $\\gamma(h)$ tends to as h goes to $\\infty$. $r$ is the `range`, or the distance at which the difference $\\gamma(h)-s$ becomes negligible. $n$ is called the `nugget` parameter. It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\n\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\n\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\n\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\n\n\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$. At this point, one can either compute the **spatial covariance**\n\n\\begin{equation}\nC(k \\Delta h)=\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k\\Delta h)d(x_i)\n\\end{equation}\n\nfrom which we can compute the **correlogram**, which is simply the spatial covariance normalized by the data variance (at $k=0$) so as to limit its range to $\\pm 1$,\n\n\\label{eq:corelogram}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\rho(k \\Delta  h)=\\frac{C(k \\Delta h)}{C(0)}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k \\Delta  h)d(x_i)}{\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^m(d(x_i)^2)}\n\\end{equation}\n\nor look at the mean squared difference and form the **semivariogram**\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\gamma(k \\Delta  h)=\\frac{1}{2m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^m\\left(d(x_i+k\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\right)^2.\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe functional forms $C(h)$, $\\rho(h)$ or $\\gamma(h)$ of these binned, discrete estimates is obtained simply by plotting $C(k\\Delta h)$, $\\rho(k\\Delta  h)$ or $\\gamma(k\\Delta  h)$ as a function of $k\\Delta h$ and by fitting a polynomial throught the results that ensures strictly positive values of $C(h)$, $\\rho(h)$ or $\\gamma(h)$ for any $h$.\n\nNote that the corelogram in geostatistics is very similar to the autocorrelation function used in time-series analysis. Indeed, as the lag-distance increases, both $\\rho(h)$ and $C(h)$ decrease, while $\\gamma(h)$ increases.\n\n---",

      "<a id='timeseries'></a>\n## Data with a time dimension\n\nEnvironmental scientists frequently need to analyse measurements that form a `sequence` - an ordered series. This series may be ordered in space (e.g. down a stratigraphic section) or in time (e.g. over the past 100 years). In either case, these are known as `time series`, and the term `time-series analysis` is used to describe the application of quantitative methods to discover patterns in the data. \n\nThe series variable can be defined either by a rank-order or by a quantitative measure of position along the series axis (time or space). To illustrate this, consider a tree rings.  A rank-order series is defined by the order that the rings appear, from inside to outside: first, second, third, ..., last.  A quantitative sequence measure, on the other hand, can be defined if each ring is dated, with ages: $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$, ..., $t_N$. (For tree rings, this is easy as one ring = one year.)\n\nA time-series consists of an observation at each entry in the rank-order or measured-time list.  This measurement can also be qualitative or quantitative.  As an example of the former, we might have a record of the presence or absence of a certain fossil-type in each layer of the stratigraphic sequence. The latter type of time-series, composed of quantitative observations, might be the height of water in a lake, the lateral displacement of a GPS station, or, in the case of tree rings, maybe the mass-fraction of a pollutant in the wood.\n\n[Time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series) data can be equally spaced or not, but if not, then extra care must be taken to analyze them. Time-series refer to sequence of discrete in time data. This also means that the points have a relationship with one-another, i.e some points cannot exist before, or after other points. That organization, containted in the order, can be exploited to learn more about real-world processes. \n\nData where time (or rank order, or sequential order) doesn't matter are sometimes called `cross sectional data`. These are sets of data observed at a single time, or where time has no meaning. \n\nTypically, time series data have the following form: \n1. a time or index variable, or (when unlucky), multiple columns that have to be combined to create a meaningful time variable (this is often the case, when year, month, day, time, etc. are in different columns)\n2. other columns of data with measurements/values of interest.\n\nNote that datasets can of course also contain [both cross-sectional and time series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsroWpkUuYI) information, in which case analysis can be performed for each time step, and across time steps, yielding for very rich analysis. For example, we could have data that measure the temporal evolution of some environmental variables in various locations. One could therefore compare locations spatially, at each time point, look at the evolution of the data at each station, and also do both. That is, time series analysis may not necessarily only concern 1D datasets, but also 2D, 3D, or ND datasets. \n\nIn general, we will consider time-series composed of $N$ entries indexed by an integer $i$ that goes from 1 to $N$.  For each value of $i$ we will have a measure of the position (e.g.~time), $t_i$, and a measure of some quantity at that time, $q_i$.  Hence a general time-series can be represented as\n$\n  t_1,\\, t_2,\\, t_3,\\,...,\\,t_{N-1},\\,t_N; \\\\\n  q_1,\\, q_2,\\, q_3,\\,...,\\,q_{N-1},\\,q_N.\n$\n\nA primary consideration in analysing a time-series is whether its entries are `regularly spaced`.  Regular spacing means that there is a constant difference between $t_{i+1}$ and $t_i$:\n\n$\n  t_{i+1} - t_i = \\Delta t\\text{, const. for all }i.\n$\n\nThe spacing between successive measurements, $\\Delta t$, could be a microsecond, or a metre, or a million years; the important point is that the same spacing applies to any pair of consecutive entries in the series.\n\nIf $\\Delta t$ is not constant, then interpolation methods can be used to interpolate the original data onto a constant grid, with constant spacing. \n\nThere are many ways to interpolate data, but not one best way. It is up to the analyst to pick the 'best' way and this will depend on the data distribution, data type, and on the research objectives. It is hard to know a-priori what works best for a given case and the analyst will need to check that her/his choice will not critically affect the conclusion of the study. \n\n`Linear interpolation` is often an excellent first choice. It is simple and fast. However, because it relies on simply interpolating [between neighboring points using strait line segments](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter17.02-Linear-Interpolation.html), the interpolated product could be 'jagged'. Depending on the smoothness of the true process sampled by the time series, `higher-order polynomials` or `splines` could be used, or, as discuss later, a `loess/lowess` fit. \n\nPython provides many functions for **interpolation**, for instance from `scipy.interpolate`, such as [`interp1d`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.interp1d.html), [`interp2d`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.interp2d.html#scipy.interpolate.interp2d) for 2D grids for linear and bilinear interpolation, or [`UnivariateSpline`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline.html#scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline) or [`BivariateSpline`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.BivariateSpline.html#scipy.interpolate.BivariateSpline) for smoother options. There are many others. \n",
      "<a id='spatial'></a>\n# Analysis of spatial data\n\nSo far in this class, we have mostly considered the analysis of data-series from single locations, where some property is measured repeadedly in time, or data that came already gridded in easy to use format. \n\nHowever, often in environmental sciences, we are faced with a different or additional problem; that is one will have to either make sense of many single measurements dispersed in space or even with multiple time-series dispersed in space. \n\nThe problem of making sense of spatially dispersed data is often linked to the problem of `contouring`. Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \n\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \n\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \n"

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",

A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

    "response": "To address this prompt effectively, I'll need to break down the provided text into manageable sections and then provide a structured response.\n\n**Section 1: Climate Models**\n\nClimate models are complex systems that aim to simulate the Earth's climate system. They use various inputs, such as observations, physical laws, and mathematical equations, to predict future climate scenarios. Climate models can be categorized into different types, including:\n\n* Global climate models (GCMs)\n* Regional climate models (RCMs)\n* Downscaling models\n\n**Section 2: Reanalysis Products**\n\nReanalysis products are model outputs that assimilate observational data to produce a best estimate of the current state of the atmosphere. The most well-known reanalysis product is ERA5, produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Other notable reanalysis products include:\n\n* NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis\n* MERRA-2\n\nReanalysis products provide a way to dynamically interpolate between observational data and offer a global picture of the atmosphere at high spatial and temporal resolutions.\n\n**Section 3: Climate Model Limitations**\n\nClimate models have several limitations, including:\n\n* Complexity: Climate models are highly complex systems that require significant computational resources.\n* Parameterization: Climate models rely on parameterizations to represent complex physical processes, which can be uncertain.\n* Initial and boundary conditions: Climate models require initial and boundary conditions to simulate the climate system.\n\n**Section 4: Criticisms of Climate Models**\n\nSome critics argue that climate models are:\n\n* Incomplete or inaccurate\n* Failing to capture important processes or feedbacks\n* Overly sensitive to parameter values\n\nHowever, proponents argue that climate models have several strengths, including:\n\n* Internal consistency and coherence\n* Ability to simulate complex physical processes\n* Potential for improving our understanding of the climate system\n\n**Section 5: Conclusion**\n\nClimate models are complex systems that aim to simulate the Earth's climate system. While they have limitations and criticisms, they also offer significant benefits, including improved understanding of the climate system and potential for predicting future climate scenarios.\n\nTo address the original prompt effectively, I would need more context or specific questions about climate models, reanalysis products, or their limitations. However, based on the provided sections, here is a structured response:\n\n**What are climate models?**\n\nClimate models are complex systems that aim to simulate the Earth's climate system using various inputs, such as observations, physical laws, and mathematical equations.\n\n**What are reanalysis products?**\n\nReanalysis products are model outputs that assimilate observational data to produce a best estimate of the current state of the atmosphere.
