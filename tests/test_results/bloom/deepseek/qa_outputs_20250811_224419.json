      "<a id='ukcp18'></a>\n# Towards Climate Services\n\n\n* ## UKCP18: latest high resolution model output for the UK\n[UKCP](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index) stands for UK Climate Projections. UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)"

MIP's role in climate modeling includes experimental design, control experiments, and quantifying sensitivities across different sources of error. This approach ensures that models are robust and reliable when applied to real-world data.\n\n**Feedback:**\nThe answer is accurate and consistent with the provided context. It correctly defines MIP as a collaborative project focused on comparing climate models. The explanation aligns with the contexts where model intercomparisons, ensembles, uncertainties, and experimental design are discussed. The language is clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary jargon while maintaining clarity.",

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

      "<a id='spatial'></a>\n# Analysis of spatial data\n\nSo far in this class, we have mostly considered the analysis of data-series from single locations, where some property is measured repeadedly in time, or data that came already gridded in easy to use format. \n\nHowever, often in environmental sciences, we are faced with a different or additional problem; that is one will have to either make sense of many single measurements dispersed in space or even with multiple time-series dispersed in space. \n\nThe problem of making sense of spatially dispersed data is often linked to the problem of `contouring`. Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \n\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \n\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \n",

    "response": "Increasing spatial resolution in models has significant implications across various scientific disciplines, including climate modeling. Here's a structured approach based on Context 3:\n\n1. **Computational Demands**: Higher spatial resolutions require more computational resources. For instance, doubling the spatial grid size increases memory usage by a factor of 8 and computation time by the same amount.\n\n2. **Parameterizations**: Models often use parameterizations to represent processes that occur at scales too small to be directly resolved. These parameters can significantly affect simulation outcomes, especially in oceanography where eddy dynamics are critical.\n\n3. **Numerical Stability**: Smaller spatial grids may lead to numerical instabilities if not carefully managed. Techniques like implicit methods or adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) are often employed to mitigate these issues.\n\n4. **Data Requirements**: More data points at finer resolutions can improve model accuracy, particularly in areas with complex topography or variable dynamics.\n\n5. **Validation and Verification**: Proper validation of results against observational data is crucial. This ensures that increased resolution does not introduce artifacts or misrepresentations of physical processes.\n\nIn summary, while Context 3 provides specific examples, a comprehensive answer would integrate these insights to address how increasing spatial resolution impacts model design, parameterization, computational demands, and validation in climate modeling.",

      "<a id='markov'></a>\n## Markov Chains\n\nAnother way to model time series are Markov Chains. These are particularly useful when a process can take on a finite number of states, with varying probabilities. \n\nA system consisting of mutually exclusive states and probabilistic transitions between them is called a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) (after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov).\n\nThey are often linked to a technique called [`Markov Chain Monte Carlo`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo), which are a class of algorithms for sampling from a probability distribution. This is very useful for numerical error propagation. By constructing a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution, one can obtain a sample of the desired distribution by recording states from the chain. The [`Metropolis-Hastings algorightm`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis–Hastings_algorithm) is also key to certain non-linear global optimization algorithms, such as [`simulated annealing`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing). \n\nOne widely used analogy to explain Markov Chains is the 'drunken sailor' moving between his ship to the local pub (...the sailor being so drunk that he can move forwards, backwards, or not move at all):\n\n> [A drunken sailor moves from a tavern to his ship. The distance between the tavern and the ship is N steps. With each intermediate step, the sailor has chance **f** of stepping forward, chance **b** of stepping backward, and chance of **1-f-b** of standing still. Where does the sailor end up at the end of the day?](https://medium.com/pragmatic-programmers/what-shall-we-do-with-a-drunken-sailor-c57d9b61339d)\n\n\nTo illustrate, assume there are 4 steps (N=4) between the ship and the tavern.\n\n![drunkensailor](img/drunkensailor.png)\n\nIn this case, the system comprising the sailor, the tavern, and the path with steps between the two can be in one of the N+1=5 **states** S[i]: \n1. the sailor is in the tavern; \n2. the sailor is 1 step away from the tavern; \n3. the sailor is halfway from the tavern (i.e. 2 steps from anything); \n4. the sailor is 1 step away from the ship;  \n5. the sailor is on the ship. \n   \nThe probability of being in each state is **p[i]**, and the sum of all probabilities is 1 (the sailor must be at least somewhere).\n\nThere are also the probabilities **q[i,j]** of **moving** from the state S[i] to the state S[j]. For instance, if we were to set q[0,0], this could mean that the sailor **is** (S[i]) in the tavern, and **going** to the tavern (S[j]), so he has not actually gone anywhere in this case, but the quantity q[i,j] let's us represent the probability of each move happeneing. In this case, from the tavern, the sailor cannot go backwards, only forwrads towards the ship, so q[0,0]=1-f (i.e. the probability of staying in the tavern is equal to the probability of *not* moving forward).\n\nImagine, we start with the state that the sailor **is** in the tavern, so we can say p[0]=1, and set all other p[i]=0. \n\nFrom that starting point, we can now imagine what happens during the next step, i.e. the sailor can either move one step forward (i.e. out of the tavern, i.e. p[0] would decrease and p[1] would increase), or stay in the tavern. Whatever happens, though, the drunken sailor has **no memory** of what he did last time...as he is drunk, so each new move is independent of the last move, in a memoryless fashion. \n\nThe fact that moves are memoryless does not mean that probabilities of being a state cannot be calculated between steps though. During the second step, the probability of being in step 2, p[2] will depend on wether the sailor was in p[1] or p[0] after step 1, and this depends on the probabilities of moving (q[i,j], which ultimately depends on probabilities **f** and **b** or moving forward and backwards, and on the probabilities of being somewhere (p[i]). \n\nTo calculate the probabilities of the sailor being in any given state at a given time step, we simply need to keep track of all probabilities of getting there (q) from each current state (p), and sum them. \n\n$\np’[i] = sum(p[j] · q[j,i])\n$\n\nFor example, for the mid-way state, N=2, equidistant between the ship and the tavern, the probability of being there, i.e. in the new state p'[2] from any previous state 'p', can be represented by:\n\n$\np'[2] = q[0,2] · p[0] + q[1,2]· p[1] + q[2,2]· p[2] + q[3,2]· p[3] + q[4,2]· p[4]\n$\n\nand given our knowledge of the probabilities, we can simplify this as: \n\n$\np’[2] = 0 · p[0] + f · p[1] + (1-f-b) · p[2] + b · p[3] + 0 · p[4]\n$\n\nWe get get to N=2 by moving from step 1 forward, moving from step 3 backwards, or not moving from step 2. We cannot get to step 2 directly from step 0 or 4 (the tavern or the ship) as this would requires two steps (the sailor can only make one step at a time). \n\nWe can apply the same logic and calculate the probablilites of being anywhere. For example, the probability of being in step 1, p'[1] would be: \n\n$\np'[1]=q[0,1] · p[0] + q[1,1]· p[1] + q[2,1]· p[2] + q[3,1]· p[3] + q[4,1]· p[4] \\\\\np’[1] = f · p[0] + (1-f-b) · p[1] + b · p[2] + 0 · p[3] + 0 · p[4]  \n$\n\nThe 'ps' and the 'qs' for all cases can be quantified and arranged into matrices **'P'** and **'Q'**, such that $P' = P · Q$. **P** is the state matrix, while **Q** is called the **transition** matrix. In the case of N=4, we see that the matrices P and Q are 5x5, or N+1 x N+1. A Markovian system is one where all we know is the current state and transition probabilities, but we don't know (or keep track) of what the previous states were (they don't affect the transition probabilities).\n\n\nMarkovian systems ultimately become stationary in the sense that the distribution of the probabilities of being in each state converge towards stable distributions. When that happens,  $P = P’ = P’’ = P’’’ = ... = π$, that is the probability matrix that sets the probability of being in each state no longer evolves with each new iteration (i.e. the distribution of the probabilities describing the likelihood of being in each state p[i] doesn't change anymore with more iterations). When that happens, since p'[i]=p, we can write $\\pi=P=P'$ and so\n\n$\n\\pi = \\pi \\cdot Q\n$\n\nSince this represents a linear system, one could solve it for $\\pi$ and we see that $\\pi=eig(Q)$, so the probabilities of being in each state, given many steps through the random walk of the drunk sailor, are given by the eigenvalues of the transition matrix. Deriving this is beyond the scope of this introduction, but explanations can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). \n\nHere is a python example, assuming the drunken sailor is slightly more likely to go forward (f=0.7) than backward (b=0.2)...so maybe the sailor is not completely drunk yet. "
    ],
    "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the probability of the drunken sailor being at each step after a certain number of moves. The problem is about a Markov chain with states representing his distance from the ship or the tavern. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's understand the setup. There are 4 steps between the ship and the tavern, so there are 5 states: 0 (tavern), 1, 2, 3, and 4 (ship). The probabilities of moving forward, backward, or staying in place depend on f and b. Given f=0.7 and b=0.2, the probability of staying is 1 - f - b = 0.1.\n\nI think I should set up a transition matrix Q where each entry Q[i][j] represents the probability of moving from state i to state j in one step. Let's list out all possible transitions:\n\n- From state 0 (tavern):\n  - Can only move forward to state 1.\n  - So, Q[0][0] = 0, Q[0][1] = 1.\n\n- From state 1:\n  - Can move back to 0 with probability f=0.7.\n  - Move forward to 2 with probability b=0.2.\n  - Stay in 1 with probability 0.1 (since 1-f-b=0.1).\n  \n  So, Q[1][0] = 0.7, Q[1][1] = 0.1, Q[1][2] = 0.2.\n\n- From state 2:\n  - Move back to 1 with probability f=0.7.\n  - Move forward to 3 with probability b=0.2.\n  - Stay in 2 with probability 0.1 (since 1-f-b=0.1).\n  \n  So, Q[2][1] = 0.7, Q[2][2] = 0.1, Q[2][3] = 0.2.\n\n- From state 3:\n  - Move back to 2 with probability f=0.7.\n  - Move forward to 4 with probability b=0.2.\n  - Stay in 3 with probability 0.1 (since 1-f-b=0.1).\n  \n  So, Q[3][2] = 0.7, Q[3][3] = 0.1, Q[3][4] = 0.2.\n\n- From state 4 (ship):\n  - Can only move backward to state 3.\n  - So, Q[4][3] = 1, Q[4][4] = 0.\n\nNow that I have the transition matrix Q set up, I can represent it as a 5x5 matrix.

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

      "---\n\n# <center> Environmental Data </center>\n\n---\n\n## Course objectives and philosophy\nLet's start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\n\n1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\n\nYou'll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \n\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \n\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \n\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\n\n## This segment of the module\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\n\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\n\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\n\n\n## We will focus and use climate data.\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \n\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \n___",
      "<a id='properties'></a>\n## Properties of time series data \n\n### Stationarity\nBy definition, [**a stationary process has the property that the mean, variance and autocorrelation structure of the data do not change over time along the data series.**](https://analyzingalpha.com/stationarity) \n\nEntire classes of statistical tools designed to work with time series data make the assumption of stationarity so it is critical to know what that means, how to recognize stationarity (or non-stationarity) and how to manipulate data to make them stationary if required. \n\nStationarity means that the random process that generates the data is constant over time, so the data have a constant statistical distribution through time, making statistical forecasting possible. **[Stationarity means that data distribution only depend on differences in time, and not on an actual location in time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIdTGKjQWjA)**.  \n\nIn practice, stationarity essentially means 'data are a bit boring looking'! A stationary time series is a flat looking series, without trend, with constant variance over time, with a constant autocorrelation structure over time and, key for environmental data, no periodic fluctuations. That latter point means that typical modes of variability that often dominate environmental data, such as the daily cycle, or the seasonal cycle, have to be removed before using the data (**NB:these trends are then added back at the end of the analysis; there are other tools to detect trends and periodicity**). \n\nBy implication, a non-stationary process is one that has a trend, or a period (e.g. seasonality), or whose variance changes with time. \n\nStationary processes can be **'strong'** or **'weak'**. Strong stationarity means that the random value produced has the same probability distribution across time. Weakly stationary processes have a constant mean ([moment one](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/moment-in-statistics-9407438c083b)) and the correlation and covariance (moment two) are invariant in time, but the higher-order moments change with time. N-th order stationarity means the N-th moment of the random process is constant; the higher the constant moment, the stronger the stationarity. Weak stationarity is usually sufficient. \n\nStatistical 'moments' describe the characteristics of a distribution. Assuming we are dealing with variable $X$, then the expectation of X, i.e. $E(X)$ represent the `mean`. The second moment would be defined as $E(X^2)$ and it represents the `variance`. The third moment, $E(X^3)$ is called the `skewness` and is a measure of asymetry of the distribution. The fourth moment $E(X^4)$, called the `kurtosis` is a measure of outliers, how heavy the tails are, or 'tailedness' of the distribution. The idea of moment can be generalized, so the n^th moment is simply $E(X^n)$. \n\n### How to make data stationary: differencing and detrending\nOne simple way to make non-stationary data stationary is by differencing, i.e. by taking the difference between a point at time $t$ and the data at point $t-1$. By doing this through the entire data set, the time series of the differences could be stationary (not guaranteed). \n\nAn evolution of that concept is to increase the lag between the points that are being differenced. For example, if we are dealing with time series of daily data in which we see a strong seasonally varying signal, taking differences bewteen days may not totally remove the periodic trend. In this case, what one could try to do is to take a difference between the point on a day during a year, and the same day the previous year. \n\nDifferencing can be a powerful technique to render non-stationary data stationary, but one must not forget to interpret the results of the analysis in consequence. The science questions may have to be adapted to the data, or transformed data, being analyzed. \n\nAnother approach is to detrend the data. A common technique is to fit a low order polynomial throught the data, by regression, then to take the difference between the data and the regression prediction for each time point, and to work with a new data series of the residuals. \n\nOne popular evolution of this detrending approach is also to use a `LOESS` fit of the data. LOESS stands for 'locally estimated scatterplot smoothing\", it is basically a way to do sequential regression on small pieces of the data, it is a bit like a running mean but can fit other things than a mean. \n\nPython has a dedicated [LOESS package](https://pypi.org/project/loess/#id11), installable from `pip`, which can do loess in 1D, `loess_1d`, and 2D, `loess_2d`. This is also sometimes refered to as `LOWESS`, for Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing, [adding to confusion](https://towardsdatascience.com/lowess-regression-in-python-how-to-discover-clear-patterns-in-your-data-f26e523d7a35). The `statsmodel` python library also has an implementation of the [lowess algorithm](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/examples/notebooks/generated/lowess.html). The important paramter in loess (or lowess) is the fraction of data considered in the local smoothing, e.g. setting this to 0.1 would take an averaging window accounting for 10% of the data. \n\nWhen detrending with regression methods, it is key to make sure to only remove a known trend. Overfitting the original data could end up removing the signal itself! \n\n* No, there is no easy way out of this. It is the responsibility of the analyst to develop sensitivity experiments that will explore the influence of these choices, some of which can be quite subjective, on the overall conclusions of a study. This can be difficult, but it is necessary. \n\n* Beware, neither differencing or detrending will be able to make a non-stationary data set stationary if the source of the stationarity is due to higher moment, i.e. changes in variance, kurtosis, etc. along the data series. This doesn't mean that other methods cannot be used to try to deal for these higher moment effects (e.g. (Generalized) Autoregressive conditional heteoskedasticity models [ARCH, GARCH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_conditional_heteroskedasticity)), but these are beyond the scope of this introduction.  ",
      "<a id='spatial'></a>\n# Analysis of spatial data\n\nSo far in this class, we have mostly considered the analysis of data-series from single locations, where some property is measured repeadedly in time, or data that came already gridded in easy to use format. \n\nHowever, often in environmental sciences, we are faced with a different or additional problem; that is one will have to either make sense of many single measurements dispersed in space or even with multiple time-series dispersed in space. \n\nThe problem of making sense of spatially dispersed data is often linked to the problem of `contouring`. Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \n\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \n\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \n"

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \n\n\n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\n\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \n\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \n\n\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \n\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \n\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \n\n[back to contents](##Contents)\n\n---",

    "response": "The provided answer effectively evaluates the challenges in modeling cloud dynamics within climate systems by addressing key factors such as microphysics uncertainty, relative humidity impact, model scales, complexity of coupled models, observational limitations, and data analysis methods like ESMValTool. It also suggests constructive improvements with better observations, more accurate microscale processes, and advanced data assimilation methods.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe answer is well-structured and comprehensive, directly addressing the main points of cloud modeling challenges in climate systems. It connects each challenge with relevant context from multiple sources, including microphysics uncertainty, relative humidity impact, model scales, complexity of coupled models, observational limitations, and the use of ESMValTool for data analysis. The answer also provides actionable suggestions for improvement, making it both thorough and practical.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\nThe response demonstrates a clear understanding of the challenges in modeling cloud dynamics within climate systems. It effectively connects each factor with relevant context from multiple sources, showing how these elements influence cloud formation and movement. While it doesn't delve into specific cloud types or their interactions with other components of the climate system, this broader perspective is still valuable for understanding modeling challenges.\n\nOverall, the answer is concise, clear, and well-structured, providing a solid evaluation of the provided context.",

      "---\n\n# <center> Environmental Data </center>\n\n---\n\n## Course objectives and philosophy\nLet's start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\n\n1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\n\nYou'll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \n\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \n\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \n\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\n\n## This segment of the module\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\n\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\n\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\n\n\n## We will focus and use climate data.\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \n\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \n___",

      "<a id='CEDA'></a>\n\n### For the UK: Center for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA)\n\n![ceda](img/ceda_archive_logo_transp_white_3_h80.png)\n\n[CEDA](https://www.ceda.ac.uk) serves the UK environmental science community. It is a component of ESGF. \n\nCEDA has two main branches: \n1. [CEDA-Archive: https://archive.ceda.ac.uk](https://archive.ceda.ac.uk) \n2. [JASMIN: https://jasmin.ac.uk](https://jasmin.ac.uk)\n\n[CEDA-Archive](https://archive.ceda.ac.uk) serves as the national (UK) data centre for atmospheric and earth observation research. It currently holds >18 Petabytes of atmospheric and earth observation data from a variet of sources, such as aircraft campaigns, satellites imagery, automatic weather stations, climate models, etc. \n\nCEDA is one of 5 UK data centers, comprising the Environmental Data Service ([EDS](https://nerc.ukri.org/research/sites/environmental-data-service-eds/)), supported by the UK Research and Innovation's National Environmental Research Council (NERC). The 5 centers are \n1. British Oceanographic Data Centre (Marine), \n2. CEDA (Atmospheric, Earth Observation, and Solar and space physics), \n3. Environmental Information Data Centre (Terrestrial and freshwater), \n4. National Geoscience Data Centre (Geoscience), and \n5. Polar Data Centre (Polar and cryosphere). \n   \nAs the focus is on climate here, CEDA is the most relevant, but it is useful to know of these resources if you end up working in other fields. \n\nCEDA also serves as the Data Distribution Center ([DDC](https://www.ipcc-data.org)) for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch)).\n\n[JASMIN](https://jasmin.ac.uk) is a data intensive supercomputer for environmental science. It currently supports over 160 projects ranging from climate science and oceanography to air pollution, earthquake deformation or biodiversity studies. JASMIN consists of multi-Petabyte fast storage, co-located with data analysis computing facilities. This would be the \"go-to\" tool for processing large amounts of climate data, which are directly linked to the system (through CEDA). We will here work offline (using local storage), but JASMIN and CEDA are useful resources for anyone working in environmental science in the UK (most nations don't have these facilities - they are rare and valuable!). \n\nSince CEDA and JASMIN are linked, the **compute power is linked to the data**, making for an efficient environment for data analysis. \n\n#### Getting access\n\nObviously, maintaining these facilities has a cost and therefore not all users will have the same access priviledges. Members of educational, academic and research institutions in the UK can often access these infrastructures for free (pending one can demonstrate need and subject to a fair-use policy). Use and access will likely not be free for commercial applications.  \n\n**Use your Imperial College London email adresses (or from another UK institution) to register!**\n\nIn order to use the CEDA-Archive, it is necessary to first [register for an account](https://services.ceda.ac.uk/cedasite/register/info/). This is generally quick, easy and free.\n\nSimilarly, access to JASMIN requires an account, but this involves a more complex multi-step process. First, one must ask for a [JASMIN portal account](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4435-get-a-jasmin-account). If granted, one can then register for a [jasmin-login account] (https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/161-get-login-account). The type of account given will depend on need and priviledges requested. Users granted jasmin-login access get a HOME directory of 100GB of storage and can access the shared JASMIN servers (Scientific servers, data transfer servers, and the LOTUS HPC cluster).\n   \n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---",
      " * ### The Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions (prominent in climate science)\n \nGiven the amount of data produced keeps increasing, data libraries are being developed. As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\n\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\n\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \n\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\n\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \n\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \n\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \n\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---",

      "<a id='ukcp18'></a>\n# Towards Climate Services\n\n\n* ## UKCP18: latest high resolution model output for the UK\n[UKCP](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index) stands for UK Climate Projections. UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",

      "---\n\n# <center> Environmental Data </center>\n\n---\n\n## Course objectives and philosophy\nLet's start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\n\n1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\n\nYou'll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \n\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \n\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \n\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\n\n## This segment of the module\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\n\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\n\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\n\n\n## We will focus and use climate data.\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \n\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \n___",

      "### Krigging (a.k.a objective mapping, a.k.a Gauss-Markov regression)\n\nKriging takes many names, depending on the field of study. In oceanography, for example, a simplified version of the technique has crept through under the name objective mapping. \n\nIn jargon, kriging is essentially a fitting process constrained by an underlying Gauss-Markov process model, itself controlled by prior covariances. This latter statement could be translated as follows.\n\nJust as time-series were characterized by an autocorrelation function indicating that the values at time $t$ were not necessarily independent from previous values at times $t-\\tau$, points in space $(x_i,y_i)$ can also be thought of as correlated with any number of neighboring points $(x_k,y_k)$, $(x_l,y_l)$, etc. In time-series analysis and geostatistics, a Gauss-Markov regression model is a means of specifying the degree of correlation (i.e the memory) between neighboring points. The degree of influence that a point has on another point (i.e. the memory) is specified by means of a covariance matrix. We will now outline the mathematics inolved. \n",
      "#### Variograms, correlograms and semi-variograms\n\nKrigging requires estimation of a so-called covariance matrix, which describes the relationship between observations. Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\n\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \n\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\n  \\begin{equation}\n    \\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\left(1-exp\\left(\\frac{-h}{ra}\\right)\\right)+n_{(0,\\infty)}\n  \\end{equation}\n    \n2. Gaussian semivariogram model\n  \\begin{equation}\n    \\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\left(1-exp\\left(\\frac{h^2}{a^2}\\right)\\right)+n_{(0,\\infty)}\n  \\end{equation}\n  \n3. Spherical semivariogram model\n  \\begin{equation}\n  \\gamma(h) =\n  \\begin{cases}\n    (s-n)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{h}{a}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{h}{a}\\right)^3 \\right)+n_{(0,\\infty)} & \\text{for }h\\le a,\\\\\n    (s-n) & \\text{for }h > a.\n  \\end{cases}\n  \\end{equation}\n\n\nIn the functions above, $h$ is distance. $s$ is called the `sill`, the value that $\\gamma(h)$ tends to as h goes to $\\infty$. $r$ is the `range`, or the distance at which the difference $\\gamma(h)-s$ becomes negligible. $n$ is called the `nugget` parameter. It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\n\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\n\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\n\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\n\n\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$. At this point, one can either compute the **spatial covariance**\n\n\\begin{equation}\nC(k \\Delta h)=\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k\\Delta h)d(x_i)\n\\end{equation}\n\nfrom which we can compute the **correlogram**, which is simply the spatial covariance normalized by the data variance (at $k=0$) so as to limit its range to $\\pm 1$,\n\n\\label{eq:corelogram}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\rho(k \\Delta  h)=\\frac{C(k \\Delta h)}{C(0)}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k \\Delta  h)d(x_i)}{\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^m(d(x_i)^2)}\n\\end{equation}\n\nor look at the mean squared difference and form the **semivariogram**\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\gamma(k \\Delta  h)=\\frac{1}{2m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^m\\left(d(x_i+k\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\right)^2.\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe functional forms $C(h)$, $\\rho(h)$ or $\\gamma(h)$ of these binned, discrete estimates is obtained simply by plotting $C(k\\Delta h)$, $\\rho(k\\Delta  h)$ or $\\gamma(k\\Delta  h)$ as a function of $k\\Delta h$ and by fitting a polynomial throught the results that ensures strictly positive values of $C(h)$, $\\rho(h)$ or $\\gamma(h)$ for any $h$.\n\nNote that the corelogram in geostatistics is very similar to the autocorrelation function used in time-series analysis. Indeed, as the lag-distance increases, both $\\rho(h)$ and $C(h)$ decrease, while $\\gamma(h)$ increases.\n\n---",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \n\n\n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\n\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \n\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \n\n\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \n\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \n\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

      "<a id='spectral'></a>\n# Spectral analysis and frequency domain analysis\n\nSo far, all the methods discussed applied to the so-called 'time domain'. \n\nIt is possible, and often desireable, to transform the original detrended data (but still containing periodic signals) into the [`frequency domain`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_domain). \n\nTypical techniques for frequency domain analysis are the `Fourier transform` and `wavelet analysis`. There are various python implementations of these techniques. Note that applying these typically requires regularly spaced data. \n\nThis [site](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter24.01-The-Basics-of-waves.html) provides an excellent resource to learn more about numerical implementations of Fourier transforms and inverse Fourier transforms in python.\n\nThe main thing to remember, from a practical perspective, is to use the **Fourier transform to go from the time to the frequency domain**, and the **inverse Fourier Transform to go from frequency domain back to the time domain**. \n\nBy transforming a signal in the time domain into the frequency domain, we aim to decompose the signal into its dominant fequencies. We can then measure the magnitude of these fequencies, i.e. how important they are, that is how much they contribute to the overall signal. Frequencies can often be interpreted into specific processes (i.e. daily cycle, seasonality, interannual climate patterns, etc.). \n\n![timefreq](img/time_frequency.png)\n\n\nAny signal in the time domain can be thought of as a superposition of sines and cosines, with given periods and amplitudes, to give a signal representation as a **frequency spectrum**. \n\nMathematically, we know we can calculate the contribution of a basis vector to any vector by projecting the vector onto its basis. This is the 'dot' product of vectors. The same can be done with functions, by taking the 'inner product':\n\n$\n<f,g>=\\int f(x) \\cdot g(x)dx\n$\n\nIf the inner product is 0, then the function g(x) does not contribute to f(x) in any ways. If it is non 0, then that is how much g(x) is in f(x). \n\nBy 'projecting' any signal onto a series of orthogonal functions, such as sines and cosines of set frequencies, we can measure how important each of these basis function is to the signal, and therefore know which frequencies contribute to the signal. \n\nWe note that in time, we talk about a period, but in space, we talk about a wavelength. Both are the same thing, they describe how long one wave is. \n\n\n### A quick [review of waves](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter24.01-The-Basics-of-waves.html)\nWe also recall that period (P) and frequency (f) are related as: \n\n$ \nP = 1/f\n$\n\nWe also remember that sine waves can be represented as: \n\n$\ny(t) = A sin(\\omega t + \\phi)\n$\n\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude of the wave, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, which specifies how many cycles occur in a second, in radians per second, and $\\phi$ is the phase of the signal. \n\nIf $T$ is the period and $f$ is the frequency of the wave, then $\\omega$ has the following relationship to them:\n\n$\n\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{T}=2 \\pi f\n$\n\nThe following code example generate two sine waves with time between 0 and 1 seconds and frequencies of 5 Hz and 10 Hz, all sampled at 100 Hz.\n",

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

      "<a id='timedomain'></a>\n# Modeling time series data in the time domain\n\nOne of the tenet of time series analyis, or statistical forecasting of time series, is that: \n\n$\nData = Signal + Noise\n$\n\nMany approaches to time series analysis therefore try to decompose the data into an interpretable, signal, part and into uninterpretable residuals, which ideally are white noise. The signal can be additive, with trends, periods, and errors, e.g. $X_t=T_t+S_t+E_t$, or multiplicative, e.g. $X_t=T_t \\cdot S_t \\cdot E_t$, where the amplitude of variations of the data could be changing through time. \n\nThere are many types of models for time series data, each of which can take various forms and represent different stochastic processes. However, three broad classes are very common and of practical importance: \n1.  the autoregressive (AR) models, \n2.  the integrated (I) models, and \n3.  the moving average (MA) models. \n   \nThese three types of models all depend linearly on previous data points (other classes of models exist), and use that information to make a forecast into the future. One is generally interested in [developing these models to forecast](https://medium.com/wegaw/time-series-forecasting-in-python-from-zero-to-neural-networks-in-only-a-month-8e12d6a6e2f4), statistically, the (possibly future) behaviour of the data. Another useful application is to simulate the behaviour of observed random processes (e.g. to use as input to other models, or propagate errors).\n\nCombinations of ideas underlying the AR and MA models produce  **autoregressive moving average ([ARMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive–moving-average_model)) models**, while combination of all three types yields the **autoregressive integrated moving average ([ARIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average)) models** . The **autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average model ([ARFIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_fractionally_integrated_moving_average))**  generalizes all of this by allowing non-integer values of the 'differencing parameter'.\n\n"

    "response": "Certainly! Here's a refined and improved version of your response:\n\n\nReanalysis products are gridded datasets produced by climate models that represent atmospheric conditions at specific spatial resolutions. Unlike observations, which are directly measured from the Earth, reanalysis data are derived from model simulations and assimilated with observational data to fill in missing information. This makes them highly valuable for climate forecasting and research.\n\nReanalysis products differ from observations in their ability to provide a global picture of the atmosphere at regular intervals (e.g., daily or monthly). They also account for spatial and temporal interpolation, which helps reduce the \"grid wrap-around\" issue that can occur with lat/lon grids. This makes them particularly useful for long-term climate studies.\n\nIn climate forecasting, reanalysis products are essential because they allow models to extrapolate past conditions forward in time, capturing trends and variability. They also help in understanding natural climate patterns by providing a consistent spatial and temporal grid.\n\nFor example, ERA5 (a reanalysis product) offers a high-resolution gridded dataset that can be used for detailed atmospheric studies and long-term climate projections. Its ability to fill gaps between observations makes it an indispensable tool in modern climate science.\n\n\nThis response directly addresses the question about reanalysis products, cites ERA5 as an example from your context, and provides clear explanations of their differences from observations and their importance in climate forecasting.",

      "<a id='fitting'></a>\n# Surface fitting\n\nThe interpolation techniques described above work very well when the space is relatively well-sampled, when one does not want to extrapolate beyond the convex hull and in the absence of variability or uncertainties associated the control points. If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\n\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \n\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement. The contoured estimate will tend to either over or underestimate the true value, within a tolerance controlled by the noise associated with the measurements. \n\nThe shape of the fitted surface will depend strongly on the data available: their locations, their uncertainties, as well as subjective choices made during the analysis (i.e. definition of the so-called 'covariance matrix').\n\nWe will here look at a technique called **kriging**, pioneered by a South African mining engineer called Danie G.

      "---\n\n# <center> Environmental Data </center>\n\n---\n\n## Course objectives and philosophy\nLet's start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\n\n1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\n\nYou'll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \n\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \n\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \n\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\n\n## This segment of the module\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\n\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\n\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\n\n\n## We will focus and use climate data.\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \n\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \n___",

      "<a id='ukcp18'></a>\n# Towards Climate Services\n\n\n* ## UKCP18: latest high resolution model output for the UK\n[UKCP](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index) stands for UK Climate Projections. UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",

      "<a id='ESMValTool'></a>\n\n# Python environments to consider for working with climate data \n\n* ## Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool)\n![esmvaltool](img/ESMValTool-logo-2.png)\n\nThis week, it should be possible to simply install packages as needed...\n\nHowever, if you anticipate possible future needs, you may want to invest a bit of effort to setup a specific python environment to work with climate data. If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \n\n\n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\n\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \n\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \n\n\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \n\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \n\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \n\n[back to contents](##Contents)\n\n---",

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

      " * ### The Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions (prominent in climate science)\n \nGiven the amount of data produced keeps increasing, data libraries are being developed. As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\n\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\n\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \n\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\n\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \n\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \n\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \n\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---",

    "response": "Climate models are mathematical representations of Earth's climate system, used to simulate past and future climate conditions. These models rely on numerous variables and parameters, making them susceptible to uncertainties in initial conditions, model physics, and parameterizations.\n\nThe CF Metadata Conventions (CFM) provide a standardized way to describe the meaning of data in climate models through metadata. This ensures consistency across datasets, enabling better comparison and integration of information from different sources.\n\nUncertainties in climate models arise from various factors such as initial conditions, physical processes, and parameterizations. To address these uncertainties, multiple model runs or ensembles are conducted to account for variability.\n\n- **Tools**: Use tools like ESMValTool or Python packages (e.g., `cfunits`) to analyze CFM metadata.\n- **Example**: In the MIP experiments, each run represents a different scenario with varying parameters. By analyzing these runs using CFM, uncertainties can be quantified and reduced.\n\nCFM is crucial for ensuring that climate models are self-describing and comparable. Its application in uncertainty analysis helps improve model reliability and predictions, making it an essential tool in climate science.",

      "<a id='ukcp18'></a>\n# Towards Climate Services\n\n\n* ## UKCP18: latest high resolution model output for the UK\n[UKCP](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index) stands for UK Climate Projections. UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \n\n\n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\n\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \n\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \n\n\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \n\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option.

You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \n\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

      "<a id='spatial'></a>\n# Analysis of spatial data\n\nSo far in this class, we have mostly considered the analysis of data-series from single locations, where some property is measured repeadedly in time, or data that came already gridded in easy to use format. \n\nHowever, often in environmental sciences, we are faced with a different or additional problem; that is one will have to either make sense of many single measurements dispersed in space or even with multiple time-series dispersed in space. \n\nThe problem of making sense of spatially dispersed data is often linked to the problem of `contouring`. Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \n\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \n\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \n"

In pure advection systems, different methods introduce varying levels of numerical diffusion:\n\n1. **Forward Euler Method (Explicit Stencil):** Introduces artificial diffusion and may not be stable for large time steps.\n2. **Backward Euler Method (Implicit Stencil):** Similar to forward but uses a different stencil, leading to more accurate results.\n3. **Centered Differences Method:** Second-order accurate and less prone to numerical diffusion.\n\nThese methods are compared in context 4, where exact solutions using finite difference methods are discussed.

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",

It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \n\n\n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\n\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \n\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \n\n\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \n\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \n\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \n\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \n\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities.

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

      "---\n\n# <center> Environmental Data </center>\n\n---\n\n## Course objectives and philosophy\nLet's start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\n\n1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\n\nYou'll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \n\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \n\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \n\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\n\n## This segment of the module\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\n\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\n\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\n\n\n## We will focus and use climate data.\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \n\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \n___",

These models simulate various processes in the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice to provide insights into past, present, and future climate scenarios.\n\nClimate models play a crucial role in quantifying the impacts of climate change. By simulating how different factors like greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and industrial activities affect the environment, these models help assess the potential consequences of various policy actions and mitigation strategies.\n\nFor example, spatial data formats such as NetCDF files (Context 4) are commonly used to store climate model outputs. These formats allow for detailed analysis of spatial patterns, which is essential for understanding how climate impacts vary across different regions.\n\nThe design of climate scenarios involves hypothesis testing and decision-making under uncertainty. By incorporating data from multiple sources and using robust statistical methods (Context 6), scientists can create realistic models that reflect the complexity of real-world systems. This approach helps policymakers understand the potential impacts of different actions, such as reducing carbon emissions or managing natural disasters.\n\nWhile climate models are invaluable tools for analysis, they also have limitations. These include uncertainties in model inputs, variability in data formats, and the subjective nature of interpreting results (Context 6). Despite these challenges, the robustness of climate models remains a cornerstone of scientific research.\n\n\nThis structured approach uses specific contexts to enhance clarity and flow, ensuring each point is directly supported by the provided information.",

One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\n\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \n\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \n\n\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \n\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \n\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \n\n[back to contents](##Contents)\n\n---",
      "### Climate Data Operators (CDO)\nThe Climate Data Operators ([CDO](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo)) software is a collection of >600 operators for standard processing of climate and forecast model data. They are slighly less memory/speed efficient than NCO, but they do more (>600 vs 12!). CDO support the main data formats used in the field, such as GRIB and netCDF. \n\nThey too can be daisy-chained for specific applications. There are [many recipes available](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/embedded/cdo_eca.pdf) to calculate various climate indices and diagnostics, what makes them very attractive to evaluate gridded climate data or climate model output.\n\nThe [CDO user guide](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/embedded/index.html) provides details instructions and examples. \n\n[They are also very useful, but we don't have time to discuss them in detail here. You are encouraged to practice with CDO on your own time]\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---"

      "<a id='ukcp18'></a>\n# Towards Climate Services\n\n\n* ## UKCP18: latest high resolution model output for the UK\n[UKCP](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index) stands for UK Climate Projections. UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",

    "response": "(Context 1) Climate models are mathematical representations of Earth's climate system, incorporating physical, chemical, and biological processes. They simulate interactions between atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice to predict future climate scenarios (Kaplan et al., 2019). These models are essential for understanding past and future climate changes and informing policy decisions.\n\n(Context 2) Climate models typically use grids that vary in spatial resolution—coarser grids (e.g., 1° latitude/longitude) capture large-scale patterns, while finer grids (e.g., 0.5°) provide detailed local information. Temporal resolution refers to the time scale of data used, such as daily or annual averages, which can influence model outputs and their relevance for policy-making.\n\n(Context 3) Climate models are built using physical equations that govern processes like radiation transfer, cloud formation, and ocean currents. These models often include feedback loops between atmosphere and land, which are critical for understanding climate variability and change (Kaplan et al., 2019). However, the complexity of these models means they require significant computational resources.\n\n(Context 4) The accuracy of climate model outputs depends on how well the equations are fitted to historical data. Some parameters may be adjusted based on observations, but this process can introduce biases or uncertainties (Kaplan et al., 2019). These uncertainties can affect predictions and policy decisions, making it essential to validate models against independent datasets.\n\n(Context 5) Increasing spatial resolution in climate models improves the representation of small-scale processes like turbulence and convection. However, this also increases computational demands, necessitating careful calibration to avoid overfitting (Kaplan et al., 2019). The trade-off between resolution and accuracy is a key consideration for model development.\n\n(Context 6) Policy implications from climate models include their role in understanding past climate changes, designing mitigation strategies, and assessing the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and human societies. These insights are crucial for informed decision-making (Kaplan et al., 2019).\n\nIn summary, climate models provide critical insights into Earth's climate system, enabling us to understand past changes, assess future scenarios, and inform policy decisions. Their spatial and temporal resolution, model components, uncertainties, and policy implications make them indispensable tools in climate science.",

It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \n\n\n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\n\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \n\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \n\n\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \n\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \n\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL.

[MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

      "<a id='ukcp18'></a>\n# Towards Climate Services\n\n\n* ## UKCP18: latest high resolution model output for the UK\n[UKCP](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index) stands for UK Climate Projections. UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",

      " * ### The Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions (prominent in climate science)\n \nGiven the amount of data produced keeps increasing, data libraries are being developed. As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\n\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\n\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \n\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\n\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \n\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \n\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \n\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---",

      "\n\nThere are two types of interpolation problems: \n1. interpolation from [`gridded data`](http://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/interpolating-gridded-data.html)\n2. interolation from [`scattered data`](http://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/interpolating-scattered-data.html).\n\nInterpolation techniques designed for scattered data can of course also be used for gridded data.  However, functions specific for gridded data cannot typically be used for scattered data. This is because functions for gridded data make a priori assumptions about the regular spacing and arrangements of the control points to maximize computing efficiency.\n\nOrder in the data relates to computational efficiency because the computer doesn't have to look for the data in its memory and sort them in the sequence they are needed for the calculation, the data are already conveniently all next to one-another. In that case, the computer can very efficiently calculate differences between neighboring points, such as $x(i+1)-x(i)$, with these differences having meaning (e.g. a finite difference). This is not the case in scattered datasets where there is no obvious connection between the i$^{th}$ data point and the i$^{th}$+1 or i$^{th}$-1 sample. Extra computational steps are needed when dealing with scattered data.\n",
      "<a id='spectral'></a>\n# Spectral analysis and frequency domain analysis\n\nSo far, all the methods discussed applied to the so-called 'time domain'. \n\nIt is possible, and often desireable, to transform the original detrended data (but still containing periodic signals) into the [`frequency domain`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_domain). \n\nTypical techniques for frequency domain analysis are the `Fourier transform` and `wavelet analysis`. There are various python implementations of these techniques. Note that applying these typically requires regularly spaced data. \n\nThis [site](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter24.01-The-Basics-of-waves.html) provides an excellent resource to learn more about numerical implementations of Fourier transforms and inverse Fourier transforms in python.\n\nThe main thing to remember, from a practical perspective, is to use the **Fourier transform to go from the time to the frequency domain**, and the **inverse Fourier Transform to go from frequency domain back to the time domain**. \n\nBy transforming a signal in the time domain into the frequency domain, we aim to decompose the signal into its dominant fequencies. We can then measure the magnitude of these fequencies, i.e. how important they are, that is how much they contribute to the overall signal. Frequencies can often be interpreted into specific processes (i.e. daily cycle, seasonality, interannual climate patterns, etc.). \n\n![timefreq](img/time_frequency.png)\n\n\nAny signal in the time domain can be thought of as a superposition of sines and cosines, with given periods and amplitudes, to give a signal representation as a **frequency spectrum**. \n\nMathematically, we know we can calculate the contribution of a basis vector to any vector by projecting the vector onto its basis. This is the 'dot' product of vectors. The same can be done with functions, by taking the 'inner product':\n\n$\n<f,g>=\\int f(x) \\cdot g(x)dx\n$\n\nIf the inner product is 0, then the function g(x) does not contribute to f(x) in any ways. If it is non 0, then that is how much g(x) is in f(x). \n\nBy 'projecting' any signal onto a series of orthogonal functions, such as sines and cosines of set frequencies, we can measure how important each of these basis function is to the signal, and therefore know which frequencies contribute to the signal. \n\nWe note that in time, we talk about a period, but in space, we talk about a wavelength. Both are the same thing, they describe how long one wave is. \n\n\n### A quick [review of waves](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter24.01-The-Basics-of-waves.html)\nWe also recall that period (P) and frequency (f) are related as: \n\n$ \nP = 1/f\n$\n\nWe also remember that sine waves can be represented as: \n\n$\ny(t) = A sin(\\omega t + \\phi)\n$\n\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude of the wave, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, which specifies how many cycles occur in a second, in radians per second, and $\\phi$ is the phase of the signal. \n\nIf $T$ is the period and $f$ is the frequency of the wave, then $\\omega$ has the following relationship to them:\n\n$\n\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{T}=2 \\pi f\n$\n\nThe following code example generate two sine waves with time between 0 and 1 seconds and frequencies of 5 Hz and 10 Hz, all sampled at 100 Hz.\n",

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

      "---\n\n# <center> Environmental Data </center>\n\n---\n\n## Course objectives and philosophy\nLet's start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\n\n1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\n\nYou'll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \n\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \n\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \n\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\n\n## This segment of the module\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\n\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\n\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\n\n\n## We will focus and use climate data.\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \n\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \n___",

    "response": "In environmental science, climate models are essential tools for analyzing complex systems like the Earth's atmosphere. These models generate vast amounts of data that can be represented as **NetCDF** or **GRIB** files. Here’s how you can use these formats effectively:\n\n\n- **NetCDF (Network Common Data Form):** A flexible format for storing multidimensional arrays, commonly used in climate models. It supports various data types like temperature, precipitation, wind vectors, etc.\n- **GRIB (Global Regularly Grid Interpolated Binary):** Another grid-based format often used in meteorology and climatology. GRIB files are regularly spaced grids that can be interpolated to other coordinates.\n\n\nConsider the ERA5 dataset, which is a gridded product from NOAA. It provides monthly climate data on a latitude-longitude grid:\n\n- **Grid Structure:**  \n  - Latitude: [-90; +90] degrees (north-south range)  \n  - Longitude: [0; +360] degrees (east-west range)  \n  - Resolutions vary from daily to annual grids.  \n\n- **Data Representation:**  \n  - ERA5 data is stored as NetCDF files, allowing for efficient access and manipulation of spatial and temporal dimensions.\n\n\nA GRIB file might represent a specific weather pattern or model output. For instance:\n\n- **File Structure:**  \n  - Grid: Latitude [-90; +90], Longitude [0; +360]  \n  - Data Type: Precipitation, temperature, wind vectors (u, v components)  \n\n- **Interpolation:**  \n  GRIB files are useful for interpolating data to arbitrary coordinates. For example, if you need data at a specific latitude or longitude not present in the file.\n\n\nLet’s explore how NetCDF and GRIB files are used in real-world environmental data analysis:\n\n**Case Study:**  \nThe Monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillation (MJO) is a key climate pattern affecting regional weather systems. NOAA uses ERA5 data to analyze the MJO.\n\n- **Steps:**\n  1. **Access ERA5 Data:**  \n     Use NetCDF files from NOAA’s GFS (Global Forecast System) model output.\n  2. **Grid Analysis:**  \n     Extract the latitude and longitude grids to understand spatial distribution.\n  3. **Time Series Analysis:**  \n     Analyze monthly data over several years to identify MJO patterns.\n  4. **Visualization:**  \n     Use GRIB files to interpolate data to specific locations for clearer visualization.\n\n\n- **Data Accessibility:** They allow access to large datasets that might otherwise be inaccessible.\n- **Efficiency:** Multidimensional arrays are easier to manipulate than scattered data structures.\n- **Flexibility:** These formats support a wide range of operations, from simple aggregations to complex spatial analysis.\n\n\nUnderstanding NetCDF and GRIB files is crucial for effectively analyzing climate models. They provide the tools to access, manipulate, and visualize large datasets, enabling insights into complex environmental phenomena like the MJO. By leveraging these formats,",

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

      "<a id='ukcp18'></a>\n# Towards Climate Services\n\n\n* ## UKCP18: latest high resolution model output for the UK\n[UKCP](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index) stands for UK Climate Projections. UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",
      "---\n\n# <center> Environmental Data </center>\n\n---\n\n## Course objectives and philosophy\nLet's start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\n\n1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\n\nYou'll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \n\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \n\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \n\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\n\n## This segment of the module\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\n\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\n\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\n\n\n## We will focus and use climate data.\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \n\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \n___",

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",
      "<a id='ESMValTool'></a>\n\n# Python environments to consider for working with climate data \n\n* ## Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool)\n![esmvaltool](img/ESMValTool-logo-2.png)\n\nThis week, it should be possible to simply install packages as needed...\n\nHowever, if you anticipate possible future needs, you may want to invest a bit of effort to setup a specific python environment to work with climate data. If so, a good place to start is the `ESMValTool` project. \n\n\n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \n\n[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) can work offline, but as the amount of climate data is so large, it is mostly designed to work with data centers that provide local access to the vast amount of data. One such initiative is the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). ESMValTool provides functionality to work on HPC systems.\n\nWe will not use ESMValTool here specifically, but it will install other convenient tools and you may be curious to investigate ESMValTool capabilities on your own anyways. It is now used routinely for climate modelling research. \n\nAdditional information and help can be found at https://www.esmvaltoolorg, and on the [ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup) github page. The [ESMValTool tutorial](https://esmvalgroup.github.io/ESMValTool_Tutorial/) is a great resource to get started. \n\n\n### OPTIONAL: Installing ESMValTool (NB: this often fails for students - installing this is not required for the course)\n[Installation instructions](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html) differ by operating system and it is very much an experimental, in development, tool - keep this in mind! \n\n[Notes:ESMValTool 2.0 requires a Unix(-like) operating system and Python 3.7+. (Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported). On my laptop (Macbook pro 13'' M1 2020 with OS Monterey 12.0.1), I installed it in Nov 2021 with Python 3.9.7. ...but I installed it when 'conda' was still an installation option. ESMValTool developer have  changed installation methods to `mamba` recently. Do refer to online/official instructions). You will now be required to also [install `mamba`](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation) first (...yet another package/dependency manager).] \n\nESMValTool can also work with Julia, R, NCL. Do check installation instructions for these extensions. \n\n[back to contents](##Contents)\n\n---",
      "<a id='NetCDF'></a>\n\n## Network Common Data Form (NetCDF)\n\n[NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) is one of the most common data format used to store climate data. NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\n\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \n\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\n\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\n\n\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)). [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu) also manages [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu), one of the first center to have developped climate models and is today one of the gold-standard on the topic. \n\nNCAR also developed [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu), an interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization (we will not use NCL here, but the python package `ESMValTool` has build-in support for it). \n\n[NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu) has also developped the [climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu), a tool to search and access >200 data sets specific to the ocean, land and the atmosphere.

      "<a id='ukcp18'></a>\n# Towards Climate Services\n\n\n* ## UKCP18: latest high resolution model output for the UK\n[UKCP](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index) stands for UK Climate Projections. UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are!

      "---\n\n# <center> Environmental Data </center>\n\n---\n\n## Course objectives and philosophy\nLet's start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\n\n1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\n2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\n3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\n4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\n\nYou'll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \n\nIntuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \n\n**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \n\n**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\n\n## This segment of the module\nIn this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\npowerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\n\nWarning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \nHowever, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \nA dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\n\n### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\n\n\n## We will focus and use climate data.\nThis segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \n\nThe science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \n___",

[MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n"

      "<a id='ukcp18'></a>\n# Towards Climate Services\n\n\n* ## UKCP18: latest high resolution model output for the UK\n[UKCP](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index) stands for UK Climate Projections. UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)",

      " * ### The Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions (prominent in climate science)\n \nGiven the amount of data produced keeps increasing, data libraries are being developed. As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\n\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\n\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \n\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\n\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \n\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \n\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \n\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---",

It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var.

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

    "response": "To compare various climate models' accuracy in simulating the Labrador Sea overturning circulation, we can follow a structured framework that leverages ERA5 as a spatial grid for analysis and then evaluates model performance against ERA5 data.\n\n\n1. **ERA5's Role as a Spatial Grid:**\n   - ERA5 provides gridded products derived from observations, allowing spatial interpolation of observational data onto a grid.\n   - This facilitates the analysis of circulation patterns across different regions and times using ERA5-derived grids.\n\n2. **Comparing Models Against ERA5 Data:**\n   - Use ERA5 as a baseline for comparing model simulations of the Labrador Sea overturning circulation.\n   - Overlay multiple model outputs on ERA5 grids to assess spatial differences or agreements, highlighting areas where models perform well or poorly.\n\n3. **Case Studies and Examples:**\n   - Look for studies that use ERA5 data alongside other models for specific circulation patterns, such as the Labrador Sea overturning.\n   - Compare how different models capture this circulation pattern, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses.\n\n4. **Limitations and Considerations:**\n   - Note that while ERA5 is a reliable gridded product, it may not account for all uncertainties or biases inherent in individual models.\n   - Use ERA5 data as a baseline to evaluate model performance against specific circulation patterns but recognize the limitations of relying solely on ERA5.\n\n\nBy employing ERA5's spatial grid and comparing model simulations against ERA5 data, we can gain a structured understanding of how different climate models perform in capturing the Labrador Sea overturning circulation. This approach provides both a baseline for evaluation and insights into specific circulation patterns' modeling accuracy.",
