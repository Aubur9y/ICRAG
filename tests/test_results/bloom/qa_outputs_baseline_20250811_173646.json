However, functions specific for gridded data cannot typically be used for scattered data. This is because functions for gridded data make a priori assumptions about the regular spacing and arrangements of the control points to maximize computing efficiency.\n\nOrder in the data relates to computational efficiency because the computer doesn't have to look for the data in its memory and sort them in the sequence they are needed for the calculation, the data are already conveniently all next to one-another. In that case, the computer can very efficiently calculate differences between neighboring points, such as $x(i+1)-x(i)$, with these differences having meaning (e.g. a finite difference). This is not the case in scattered datasets where there is no obvious connection between the i$^{th}$ data point and the i$^{th}$+1 or i$^{th}$-1 sample. Extra computational steps are needed when dealing with scattered data.\n",

That error, from q+1 steps away in the past, does not affect the predictions of $X_t$. For this reason, MA models are called [`short memory models`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNLG8tsA_Go).\n\n\nLooking back that AR(1) example above, expanded to show the influence of the first observation ($X_1$): \n\n$\nX_t = \\frac{c}{1-\\phi} + (\\phi_1)^t X_{1}  + \\left[ \\phi_1^{t-1} \\epsilon_{2} + \\phi_1^{t-2} \\epsilon_{3}+ ... + \\epsilon_t \\right]\n$\n\nwe see that the term in square bracket is actually nothing else but a large moving average term, essentially collecting all the short memory errors.

      "<a id='spatial'></a>\n# Analysis of spatial data\n\nSo far in this class, we have mostly considered the analysis of data-series from single locations, where some property is measured repeadedly in time, or data that came already gridded in easy to use format. \n\nHowever, often in environmental sciences, we are faced with a different or additional problem; that is one will have to either make sense of many single measurements dispersed in space or even with multiple time-series dispersed in space. \n\nThe problem of making sense of spatially dispersed data is often linked to the problem of `contouring`. Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \n\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \n\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \n",
      "<a id='fitting'></a>\n# Surface fitting\n\nThe interpolation techniques described above work very well when the space is relatively well-sampled, when one does not want to extrapolate beyond the convex hull and in the absence of variability or uncertainties associated the control points. If these conditions are not met, a better approach to interpreting spatial data may be **to fit a surface across the collection of samples** rather than to force a surface to pass exactly through each control point. This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\n\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \n\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement. The contoured estimate will tend to either over or underestimate the true value, within a tolerance controlled by the noise associated with the measurements. \n\nThe shape of the fitted surface will depend strongly on the data available: their locations, their uncertainties, as well as subjective choices made during the analysis (i.e. definition of the so-called 'covariance matrix').\n\nWe will here look at a technique called **kriging**, pioneered by a South African mining engineer called Danie G. Krige (1919-2013) and further formalized by geologist and mathematician Georges Matheron (1930-2000), who, together with Jean Serra, is often considered to be the founder of geostatistics.\n"

      "<a id='markov'></a>\n## Markov Chains\n\nAnother way to model time series are Markov Chains. These are particularly useful when a process can take on a finite number of states, with varying probabilities. \n\nA system consisting of mutually exclusive states and probabilistic transitions between them is called a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) (after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov).\n\nThey are often linked to a technique called [`Markov Chain Monte Carlo`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo), which are a class of algorithms for sampling from a probability distribution. This is very useful for numerical error propagation. By constructing a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution, one can obtain a sample of the desired distribution by recording states from the chain. The [`Metropolis-Hastings algorightm`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis–Hastings_algorithm) is also key to certain non-linear global optimization algorithms, such as [`simulated annealing`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing). \n\nOne widely used analogy to explain Markov Chains is the 'drunken sailor' moving between his ship to the local pub (...the sailor being so drunk that he can move forwards, backwards, or not move at all):\n\n> [A drunken sailor moves from a tavern to his ship. The distance between the tavern and the ship is N steps. With each intermediate step, the sailor has chance **f** of stepping forward, chance **b** of stepping backward, and chance of **1-f-b** of standing still. Where does the sailor end up at the end of the day?](https://medium.com/pragmatic-programmers/what-shall-we-do-with-a-drunken-sailor-c57d9b61339d)\n\n\nTo illustrate, assume there are 4 steps (N=4) between the ship and the tavern.\n\n![drunkensailor](img/drunkensailor.png)\n\nIn this case, the system comprising the sailor, the tavern, and the path with steps between the two can be in one of the N+1=5 **states** S[i]: \n1. the sailor is in the tavern; \n2. the sailor is 1 step away from the tavern; \n3. the sailor is halfway from the tavern (i.e. 2 steps from anything); \n4. the sailor is 1 step away from the ship;  \n5. the sailor is on the ship. \n   \nThe probability of being in each state is **p[i]**, and the sum of all probabilities is 1 (the sailor must be at least somewhere).\n\nThere are also the probabilities **q[i,j]** of **moving** from the state S[i] to the state S[j]. For instance, if we were to set q[0,0], this could mean that the sailor **is** (S[i]) in the tavern, and **going** to the tavern (S[j]), so he has not actually gone anywhere in this case, but the quantity q[i,j] let's us represent the probability of each move happeneing. In this case, from the tavern, the sailor cannot go backwards, only forwrads towards the ship, so q[0,0]=1-f (i.e. the probability of staying in the tavern is equal to the probability of *not* moving forward).\n\nImagine, we start with the state that the sailor **is** in the tavern, so we can say p[0]=1, and set all other p[i]=0. \n\nFrom that starting point, we can now imagine what happens during the next step, i.e. the sailor can either move one step forward (i.e. out of the tavern, i.e. p[0] would decrease and p[1] would increase), or stay in the tavern. Whatever happens, though, the drunken sailor has **no memory** of what he did last time...as he is drunk, so each new move is independent of the last move, in a memoryless fashion. \n\nThe fact that moves are memoryless does not mean that probabilities of being a state cannot be calculated between steps though. During the second step, the probability of being in step 2, p[2] will depend on wether the sailor was in p[1] or p[0] after step 1, and this depends on the probabilities of moving (q[i,j], which ultimately depends on probabilities **f** and **b** or moving forward and backwards, and on the probabilities of being somewhere (p[i]). \n\nTo calculate the probabilities of the sailor being in any given state at a given time step, we simply need to keep track of all probabilities of getting there (q) from each current state (p), and sum them. \n\n$\np’[i] = sum(p[j] · q[j,i])\n$\n\nFor example, for the mid-way state, N=2, equidistant between the ship and the tavern, the probability of being there, i.e. in the new state p'[2] from any previous state 'p', can be represented by:\n\n$\np'[2] = q[0,2] · p[0] + q[1,2]· p[1] + q[2,2]· p[2] + q[3,2]· p[3] + q[4,2]· p[4]\n$\n\nand given our knowledge of the probabilities, we can simplify this as: \n\n$\np’[2] = 0 · p[0] + f · p[1] + (1-f-b) · p[2] + b · p[3] + 0 · p[4]\n$\n\nWe get get to N=2 by moving from step 1 forward, moving from step 3 backwards, or not moving from step 2. We cannot get to step 2 directly from step 0 or 4 (the tavern or the ship) as this would requires two steps (the sailor can only make one step at a time). \n\nWe can apply the same logic and calculate the probablilites of being anywhere. For example, the probability of being in step 1, p'[1] would be: \n\n$\np'[1]=q[0,1] · p[0] + q[1,1]· p[1] + q[2,1]· p[2] + q[3,1]· p[3] + q[4,1]· p[4] \\\\\np’[1] = f · p[0] + (1-f-b) · p[1] + b · p[2] + 0 · p[3] + 0 · p[4]  \n$\n\nThe 'ps' and the 'qs' for all cases can be quantified and arranged into matrices **'P'** and **'Q'**, such that $P' = P · Q$. **P** is the state matrix, while **Q** is called the **transition** matrix. In the case of N=4, we see that the matrices P and Q are 5x5, or N+1 x N+1. A Markovian system is one where all we know is the current state and transition probabilities, but we don't know (or keep track) of what the previous states were (they don't affect the transition probabilities).\n\n\nMarkovian systems ultimately become stationary in the sense that the distribution of the probabilities of being in each state converge towards stable distributions. When that happens,  $P = P’ = P’’ = P’’’ = ... = π$, that is the probability matrix that sets the probability of being in each state no longer evolves with each new iteration (i.e. the distribution of the probabilities describing the likelihood of being in each state p[i] doesn't change anymore with more iterations). When that happens, since p'[i]=p, we can write $\\pi=P=P'$ and so\n\n$\n\\pi = \\pi \\cdot Q\n$\n\nSince this represents a linear system, one could solve it for $\\pi$ and we see that $\\pi=eig(Q)$, so the probabilities of being in each state, given many steps through the random walk of the drunk sailor, are given by the eigenvalues of the transition matrix. Deriving this is beyond the scope of this introduction, but explanations can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). \n\nHere is a python example, assuming the drunken sailor is slightly more likely to go forward (f=0.7) than backward (b=0.2)...so maybe the sailor is not completely drunk yet.

      " * ### The Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions (prominent in climate science)\n \nGiven the amount of data produced keeps increasing, data libraries are being developed. As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\n\nMultiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\n\nCEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \n\nThe CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\n\nOne example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \n\nTo illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \n\nA [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \n\nThe CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---",
      "### The CDS Toolbox\n\nAn extention to the CDS API is the [CDS Toolbox](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/toolbox/doc/index.html). The Toolbox is a programming interface. It is free and available to everyone. It links raw data to an online computing facility, thereby removing the computing barrier for users worldwide. The Toolbox allows users to develop python scripts for the CDS and to run them online. The users than then simply download the maps, graph or secondary data without needing to incur the costs associated with storing and maintaining the large climate data archive locally, nor is it required to invest in a powerful computer. \n\n\nThe Toolbox works hand-in-hand with the CDS API. \n\nThat is, one can issue commmands to the Toolbox via the CDS API, or develop a python script that does certain things, and then use the CDS API functionality to send it to CDS for evaluation, only to download the finished product locally. \n\nExamples of how to proceed are given [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/COPSRV/Call+a+service+with+the+CDS+API). \n\nNote, it is also possible to use the CDS Toolbox to plot data from other services (i.e. not originally stored on CDS), using the `remote` function instead of the `service` function. This is possible thanks to protocols such as OPeNDAP. Here is an example using data from UNIDATA. \n\nFor illustration of how the Toolbox can be used, the following piece of code, run locally, after the CDS API is properly configured and assuming one is connected to the internet, will produce, and then download to our `output/` directory, a map of global temperature on January 1st 2021 at 14:00."

    "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question about the key differences between forward, backward, and centered difference schemes in numerical models. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what each scheme entails. From Context 1, forward difference is mentioned as Forward Euler, which uses the current value to predict the next. The equation given is dCdt = λCCi+1 - CiΔt, but the exact formula might be different. The user mentioned that forward schemes use the current value (Ci) and the next value (Ci+1), so the forward difference is Ci+1 = Ci + λΔt. \n\nThen there's backward difference, which is called backward Euler. Context 1 says it requires solving an equation, which implies it's an implicit scheme. The equation here is dCdt = λCCi+1 - Ci-1Δt, but the exact form might be Ci-1 = ...? Wait, the user's Context 1 mentions \"Backward difference(aka backward Euler) Requires solving...\" but the exact equation isn't fully provided. However, the key point is that backward schemes use the previous value (Ci-1) to compute the next step, making them implicit.\n\nCentered difference is mentioned in Context 2. It requires knowing more points, specifically Ci+1 and Ci-1, and the equation is Ci+1 = Ci1 + λΔt. Wait, the equation given is Ci+1 = Ci1 + λΔt, but that seems like forward. Wait, no, Context 2 says \"Requires knowing more things from more points\" and the equation is dCdt = λCCi+1 - Ci-12Δt = λCiCi+1 = 2λΔtCi+Ci-1. So the centered difference scheme uses both Ci+1 and Ci-1, leading to the equation Ci+1 = Ci1 + λΔt. Wait, maybe the equation is Ci+1 = Ci + λΔt, but that's forward. Hmm, maybe the centered difference is Ci+1 = Ci1 + λΔt, but that's not standard. Wait, the equation in Context 2 is dCdt = λCCi+1 - Ci-12Δt = λCiCi+1 = 2λΔtCi+Ci-1. So the centered difference scheme uses both Ci+1 and Ci-1, leading to the equation Ci+1 = Ci1 + λΔt. Wait, but that's not standard. Maybe the centered difference is Ci+1 = Ci + λΔt, but that's forward. I need to check the exact equations.\n\nIn Context 1, forward difference is Ci+1 = Ci1 + λΔt. Backward difference is Ci-1 = Ci1 - λΔt. Centered difference is Ci+1 = Ci1 + λΔt, but that's the same as forward. Wait, no. The centered difference would be Ci+1 = Ci + λΔt, but that's forward. Wait, maybe the centered difference is Ci+1 = Ci1 + λΔt, but that's forward. This is confusing. Let me recheck.\n\nContext 2 says: \"Requires knowing more things from more points\" and the equation is dCdt = λCCi+1 - Ci-12Δt = λCiCi+1 = 2λΔtCi+Ci-1. So the centered difference scheme uses both Ci+1 and Ci-1, leading to the equation Ci+1 = Ci1 + λΔt. Wait, but that's not standard. Normally, centered difference would be (Ci+1 - Ci-1)/(2Δx), but here it's written as Ci+1 = Ci1 + λΔt. Maybe the equation is Ci+1 = Ci + λΔt, which is forward. But the user's Context 2 mentions that centered difference requires more points, so the equation is Ci+1 = Ci1 + λΔt. But this is unclear. \n\nThe key differences are: forward schemes use only the current value (Ci) to compute the next step (Ci+1), backward schemes use the previous value (Ci-1), and centered schemes use both Ci and Ci+1, leading to a more accurate approximation. However, the exact equations might vary. \n\nSo, the answer should outline that forward difference uses Ci to compute Ci+1, backward uses Ci-1, and centered uses both Ci and Ci+1. The exact equations are given in the contexts, but the user's question is about the key differences, not the equations. So the answer would state that forward schemes (like Forward Euler) use the current value, backward schemes (implicit) use the previous value, and centered schemes use both current and next values. The exact equations are in the contexts, but the main differences are the number of points used and the type of scheme (explicit vs",

It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

      "<a id='NetCDF'></a>\n\n## Network Common Data Form (NetCDF)\n\n[NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) is one of the most common data format used to store climate data. NetCDF files allow the user to insert metadata in the data file by design, ensuring the data file is self-describing (amongst other properties).\n\n*NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.* \n\nThe netCDF format, which is a type of HDF format, is attractive because it is:\n\n* Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains and metadata.\n* Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\n* Scalable. Small subsets of large datasets in various formats may be accessed efficiently through netCDF interfaces, even from remote servers.\n* Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\n* Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\n* Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\n\n\nThe NetCDF project is maintained by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ([UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu)). [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu) also manages [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu), one of the first center to have developped climate models and is today one of the gold-standard on the topic. \n\nNCAR also developed [NCL](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu), an interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization (we will not use NCL here, but the python package `ESMValTool` has build-in support for it). \n\n[NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu) has also developped the [climate data guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu), a tool to search and access >200 data sets specific to the ocean, land and the atmosphere. (Some of these data may or may not also be found on CEDA.) \n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---"

      "#### Variograms, correlograms and semi-variograms\n\nKrigging requires estimation of a so-called covariance matrix, which describes the relationship between observations. Defining the elements of the covariance matrix is an 'art-form'.\n\nOne may choose to use an existing form of a covariance function, also called covariogram, or just variogram. The semivariogram, often defined as $\\gamma(h)$ is $1/2$ the variogram.  \n\nPopular examples of isotropic semivariograms are:\n1. Exponential semivariogram model\n  \\begin{equation}\n    \\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\left(1-exp\\left(\\frac{-h}{ra}\\right)\\right)+n_{(0,\\infty)}\n  \\end{equation}\n    \n2. Gaussian semivariogram model\n  \\begin{equation}\n    \\gamma(h)=(s-n)\\left(1-exp\\left(\\frac{h^2}{a^2}\\right)\\right)+n_{(0,\\infty)}\n  \\end{equation}\n  \n3. Spherical semivariogram model\n  \\begin{equation}\n  \\gamma(h) =\n  \\begin{cases}\n    (s-n)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{h}{a}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{h}{a}\\right)^3 \\right)+n_{(0,\\infty)} & \\text{for }h\\le a,\\\\\n    (s-n) & \\text{for }h > a.\n  \\end{cases}\n  \\end{equation}\n\n\nIn the functions above, $h$ is distance. $s$ is called the `sill`, the value that $\\gamma(h)$ tends to as h goes to $\\infty$. $r$ is the `range`, or the distance at which the difference $\\gamma(h)-s$ becomes negligible. $n$ is called the `nugget` parameter. It is an offset that applies for all $h>0$. The nugget parameter accounts for very small scale heterogenities. Imagine measuring gold concentration at point $x_0$ which happens to be in a gold nugget. A finite distance away, gold concentration falls drastically, but beyond that, the concentration may decrease progressively. The nugget parameter aims to account for this type of jumps. $a$ is a constant, which varies, often it is $1/3$.\n\n![variogram](img/variogramexample.png)\n\nMore detailed information on variograms be found [here](https://medium.com/@nikhil.munna001/kriging-implementation-in-python-with-source-code-541b9b5c35f)\n\n**Anisotrophic variogram**, that not only depend on $h$, but also on the direction of the vector $h$ models, also exist. Anisotropic variograms are routinely used in oceanography, where meridional motions away from boundaries are strongly restricted by the Earth rotation. For this reason, maps made for oceanic tracers tend to use a long longitudinal range and a short latitudinal range.\n\n\nIf we have a dense dataset, one may try to estimate the variogram empirically. To achieve this, one first subtract the mean (or a trend) from the data. We then **bin all possible pairs of data by their distance of separation** in intervals of say $k\\Delta h$, with $k=1,2,...,K$. At this point, one can either compute the **spatial covariance**\n\n\\begin{equation}\nC(k \\Delta h)=\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k\\Delta h)d(x_i)\n\\end{equation}\n\nfrom which we can compute the **correlogram**, which is simply the spatial covariance normalized by the data variance (at $k=0$) so as to limit its range to $\\pm 1$,\n\n\\label{eq:corelogram}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\rho(k \\Delta  h)=\\frac{C(k \\Delta h)}{C(0)}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^md(x_i+k \\Delta  h)d(x_i)}{\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^m(d(x_i)^2)}\n\\end{equation}\n\nor look at the mean squared difference and form the **semivariogram**\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\gamma(k \\Delta  h)=\\frac{1}{2m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^m\\left(d(x_i+k\\Delta h)d(x_i)\\right)^2.\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe functional forms $C(h)$, $\\rho(h)$ or $\\gamma(h)$ of these binned, discrete estimates is obtained simply by plotting $C(k\\Delta h)$, $\\rho(k\\Delta  h)$ or $\\gamma(k\\Delta  h)$ as a function of $k\\Delta h$ and by fitting a polynomial throught the results that ensures strictly positive values of $C(h)$, $\\rho(h)$ or $\\gamma(h)$ for any $h$.\n\nNote that the corelogram in geostatistics is very similar to the autocorrelation function used in time-series analysis. Indeed, as the lag-distance increases, both $\\rho(h)$ and $C(h)$ decrease, while $\\gamma(h)$ increases.\n\n---",
      "- **Attributes**: The last category of information required are 'attributes'. Attributes can be `global' or 'variable'-specific. 'Global' attributes are for the whole Dataset or the group. 'Variable' attributes only inform on a specific variable (or coordinate variable).  \n\n`Dataset.ncattrs` can be used to retrieve attributes from a NetCDF file. Alternatively, the `__dict__` attribute of a Dataset, Group or Variable will return the name/value pairs for all the attributes. \n\nLet's define some attribute to the time coordinate variable (or dimension):",
      "### Krigging (a.k.a objective mapping, a.k.a Gauss-Markov regression)\n\nKriging takes many names, depending on the field of study. In oceanography, for example, a simplified version of the technique has crept through under the name objective mapping. \n\nIn jargon, kriging is essentially a fitting process constrained by an underlying Gauss-Markov process model, itself controlled by prior covariances. This latter statement could be translated as follows.\n\nJust as time-series were characterized by an autocorrelation function indicating that the values at time $t$ were not necessarily independent from previous values at times $t-\\tau$, points in space $(x_i,y_i)$ can also be thought of as correlated with any number of neighboring points $(x_k,y_k)$, $(x_l,y_l)$, etc. In time-series analysis and geostatistics, a Gauss-Markov regression model is a means of specifying the degree of correlation (i.e the memory) between neighboring points. The degree of influence that a point has on another point (i.e. the memory) is specified by means of a covariance matrix. We will now outline the mathematics inolved. \n"

This process is sometimes called optimal interpolation because it involves mininizing misfit errors.\n\nAn optimally interpolated surface will tend to be smoother than the original data field. \n\nThe contoured values at locations where samples exist won't equal to the data point at that location due to the noise associated with each measurement.

With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \n\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \n"

      "<a id='AR'></a>\n### AR(p) (Auto Regressive Models)\n[Autoregressive (AR(p)) models](https://otexts.com/fpp2/AR.html) are models which use previous values to predict the current value (or guess the next one) of the same variable. They are like regression models, but use lagged values of the variable itself, instead of another variable, as a predictor variable. The number of previous values used is called the **`order`** of the AR model. \n\nAR(p) models have the following form: \n\n$\nX_t=c+\\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\phi_i X_{t-i}+\\epsilon_t\n$\n\nwhere $\\phi_i$ are parameters that depend on the order of the AR model, $c$ is a constant and $\\epsilon_t$ is random, white noise, error. Error terms $\\varepsilon_t$ are generally assumed to be independent identically distributed random variables (i.i.d.) sampled from a normal distribution with zero mean: $\\varepsilon _{t} ~ N(0,\\sigma^2)$ where $\\sigma^2$ is the variance. \n\nGiven that definition, the expanded form of AR(1) would be for $X_t$:\n\n$\nX_t = c + (\\phi_1)X_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t\n$\n\nand AR(2) would be\n\n$\nX_t = c + \\phi_1 X_{t-1} + \\phi_2 X_{t-2}  + \\epsilon_t\n$\n\netc. \n\nThe expanded forms show clearly how the current value $X_t$ is obtained from the lagged values $X_{t-i}$.\n\nNow, in addition to $X_{t}$, let's also expand the form of $X_{t-1}$. AR(1) for $X_{t-1}$ would be\n\n$\nX_{t-1} = c + \\phi_1 X_{t-2}  + \\epsilon_{t-1}\n$\n\nSo we can say that \n\n$\nX_t = c + (\\phi_1) \\left(c + \\phi_1 X_{t-2}  + \\epsilon_{t-1} \\right) + \\epsilon_t\n$\n\nwhich we could rewrite as\n\n$\nX_t = c^* + (\\phi_1)^2 X_{t-2}  + \\phi_1 \\epsilon_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t\n$\n\nand we see that $X_t$ is not only dependent on $X_{t-1}$, but also on $X_{t-2}$ since $X_{t-1}$ did depend on it. In fact, we can show that \n\n$\nX_t = \\frac{c}{1-\\phi} + (\\phi_1)^t X_{1}  + \\phi_1^{t-1} \\epsilon_{2} + \\phi_1^{t-2} \\epsilon_{3}+ ... + \\epsilon_t\n$\n\nand we see that the current value of $X_t$, to a very small degree (i.e. through $\\phi^t$), does actually depend, in a small way, even on the very first value of the data series, $X_1$. For this reason, we say that AR models are [`long memory models`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc6sBAUdDP4&t=3s). \n\nAR models can be restricted to stationary data if the parameters $\\phi$ [obey certain rules](https://otexts.com/fpp2/AR.html):\n- For AR(1): $-1 < \\phi < 1$\n- For AR(2): $-1 < \\phi_2 < 1, \\phi_1 + \\phi_2 <1, \\phi_2 - \\phi_1 <1$\n\nfor p>2, restrictions are more complicated. Algorithms typically take care of these rules automatically when estimating AR models (i.e. fitting $\\phi$ values). \n\nTo illustrate AR models, let's try to code a dummy one here: ",

UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n\n[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n\nUKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n\nAlthough UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n\n### Accessing UKCP18 data\n\nInstructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n\nAccessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n\nThere is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n\n[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n\n### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\nOur goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \nTo use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n\n**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n\nOnce you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n\n Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n\nTick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n3. Output: Data only\n4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n   \nThis will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n\n![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n\nNote the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n\n**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n\nMake sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are!

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",
      "One can also modify the CDS API download script using optional post-processing arguments.\n\nFor example, one can use the `grid` option to change the grid on which the data are presented.  \n\nThe native grid of ERA data on CDS is 0.25°x0.25° (atmosphere), 0.5°x0.5° (ocean waves) for variables, while derived quantities, such as mean and variance are on a 0.5°x0.5° (atmosphere) and a coarser 1°x1° (ocean waves). ERA5-Land is provided as 0.1°x0.1°. These grid resolutions will be provided by default, but perhaps one does not needs such high resolution for our application, and one may only be interested in a subset of the global dataset, in which case, it makes sense to minimize the local computational and storage burden and to use the CDS API to provide a coarser and more focused data file. \n\nThe following script shows an [example](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+download+ERA5#HowtodownloadERA5-3-DownloadingonlineERA5familydatathroughtheCDSwebinterface), where the resolution is decreased to 1 degree by 1 degree and a sub-domain is selected (in case one does not need global coverage): ",

Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \n\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \n\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \n"

      "<a id='question'></a>\n\n# Driving question to answer this week: \nIt is ok to learn techniques and go through practicals, but the overal objective of this course is to equip you with the skills needed to pursue your own analyses. With this in mind, we are going to work towards a central question, to motivate learning though the next few lessons.  \n\n\n* ## Should French Champagne makers invest in wineries in Hampshire (UK)?\n\nRecently, [french champagne producer Tattinger have decided to invest in a winery in Kent, called Domaine Evremond](https://www.domaineevremond.com).  Tattinger is aware that other English wineries in [Hampshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampshire) are also [producing excellent sparkling wine](https://www.visit-hampshire.co.uk/food-and-drink/vineyards). \n\nTattinger's business wing is of course concerned about this. Are these new UK wineries going to be strong competitors for them, or should Tattinger see these as investment opportunities and try to buy them while they can to establish a stronger presence in the UK market?\n\nLike everyone else, Tattinger is also aware about climate change and they realize that, from now on, they need to systematically incorporate a climate analysis as part of their business decisions.  \n\nFrom the growing success of English winemakers, Tattinger can see that the current climate in the Hampshire region is good enough at the moment for growing good grapes, but they want to know if and how climate change will affect the current climate in Hampshire. Ultimately, they want to know if climate change could affect the wine buisness in Hampshire. Will climate change negatively affect viticulture in the region, should we expect little change, or are conditions actually going to become even better for growing grapes in the next few decades? \n\nImagine that your new start-up, as an up-and-coming climate intelligence company, is being contacted by representatives from Tattinger HQ to advise them on how climate will change in Hampshire. They want to know how climate change may affect wineries in Hampshire in the coming 50 years or so and they are looking for someone to deliver answers.  \n\n**Your task is to i) develop a research strategy that will answer their questions on the future of climate in Hampshire, ii) present initial results on the issue, and iii) issue a preliminary recommendation as to wether Tattinger should or should not invest in UK wineries going forward.**\n\nSadly, time is of the essence! Tattinger has heard that [Moet-et-Chandon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moët_&_Chandon), another major champagne producer, is also eyeing on these buisness opportunities and they must make a decision quickly. **You will be expected to produce a jupyter notebook by Thursday afternoon that summarizes your analysis and recommendations to Tattinger. While you will not be required to submit this code, you will be able to refer back to it during the final assessed quiz, so doing a thorough job will help. The final quiz will certainly ask questions related to this experience, such as file formats, limitations of data, etc.** \n\nIn your analysis, consider which data you want to use, how to get them (can you access and analyze them already?), what could be learned from them. Consider resolution, data use policy, data storage and analytical requirements (would you need to use a cloud service or supercomputer do perform the analysis? if so, could you use this for free as a commercial entity, if not, how much could that cost?). You may also want to use output from reanalysis products (e.g. ERA5) or climate models (UKCP18, CMIP, etc.). \n\nUse any and all resources at your disposal (including your instructor and your classmates) but keep in mind that **this is a commercial project**, so beware of any data use or resource access policies in place. In the real world, it could be that addressing this question would imply some costs that could be passed on to the client. However, the rules for this exercise are to only use open-acess resources. \n\nYou don't have much time, but this could be a big and important contract for your new company so you want to develop a good solution, ideally with some preliminary results to showcase your skills, and prove to Tattinger that you are the right people for the job. Your company could earn future business from them! \n\n**IMPORTANT**: Although you are encouraged to exchange with your classmates and exchange ideas, source of data, and work in groups, you will only be able to rely on your own code during the quiz.** \n\n---"

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n\n[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n\nImportantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n\nERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n\nThe article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n\nWhile observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n\n**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n\n**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n\n\n[back to contents](#Contents)\n\n---\n",

      "<a id='spatial'></a>\n# Analysis of spatial data\n\nSo far in this class, we have mostly considered the analysis of data-series from single locations, where some property is measured repeadedly in time, or data that came already gridded in easy to use format. \n\nHowever, often in environmental sciences, we are faced with a different or additional problem; that is one will have to either make sense of many single measurements dispersed in space or even with multiple time-series dispersed in space. \n\nThe problem of making sense of spatially dispersed data is often linked to the problem of `contouring`. Contouring essentially means guessing what the measured scalar or vector field looks like where it was not sampled. As in 1D cases, there are **two ways** of approaching the problem. One can either **interpolate** between available samples or **fit a function** that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the measured data. We will here review the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce some commands and libraries that are useful to interpret spatial data. \n\nHistorically, contouring was done by eye. With the advent of computing, however, there are now algorithms which can be used to automate the process. It should be emphasized, though, that no algorithm is perfect (as we already know!). The advantage of computer-based contouring is that it is at least repeatable, whereas contouring by eye involves a lot of subjective choices. For this reason, computer-based mapping is sometimes said to be `objective`. As we will see below though, this does not mean that everything is truely automatic: choices made affect results and their interpretation. \n\nWhile contouring algorithms will typically work fine in simple cases, they often have a hard time dealing with discontinuities. For example, most 'out-of-the-box' contouring programs will interpolate across montains or, in oceanography, will ,forget, that continents separate the Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. While we will only look at simple cases here, one should be aware\n1. that more complicated techniques exist than those presented here\n2. that using the wrong algorithm can result in catastrophically bad maps that introduce features that do not actually exist, what could have severe or costly implications. \n",

This generally depends on whether the data are supplied on a regular grid (fixed latitudes and longtiude steps), or not. The native model grids are rarely regular (they can be curved and the resolution typically changes regionally, so providing vectors of latitudes and longitudes simply wouldn't make any sense). ",

    "response": "The methodology for comparing the performance of climate models in representing the Labrador Sea overturning circulation involves the following steps:  \n1. **Define the Research Question**: Focus on the overturning circulation's magnitude, location, and temporal variability.  \n2. **Data Preparation**: Use model output arrays **X** and **Y** (e.g., salinity/temperature fields) and observational data from the Labrador Sea. Ensure resolution aligns with the scale of overturning (Context 2).  \n3. **Model Selection**: Compare models with varying resolutions (higher vs. lower) and time/space scales (short vs. long simulations) to address computational limitations (Context 1).  \n4. **Performance Evaluation**: Assess spatial and temporal similarity between model outputs and observations, focusing on overturning metrics (e.g., heat transport, salinity gradients).  \n5. **Challenge Addressal**: Account for unresolved microphysics (Context 3) and grid cell size mismatches, using proxy metrics or ensemble comparisons where feasible.  \n6. **Validation**: Cross-check results with independent datasets or reanalysis products to validate model accuracy.  \n\nThis approach balances model simplicity with necessary resolution, leveraging array-based comparisons and observational benchmarks.
